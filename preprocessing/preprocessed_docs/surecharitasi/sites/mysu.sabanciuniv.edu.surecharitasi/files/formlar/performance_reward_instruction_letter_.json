KPI: \"Key Performance Indicator\". It is a measurement used to measure how successful the university, unit or employee is in the relevant performance period. Reward Period / Performance Period: For employees who started working on or before January 1, it refers to the one-year period starting on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the relevant year, and for employees who started working during the year, it refers to the period between their start dates and December 31. Reward Pool: Total reward amount calculated assuming that all employees in the scope achieve 100% of their targets. Reward Pool Multiplier: Multiplier that increases or decreases the Reward Pool in order to calculate the reward amount that can be distributed by the university, determined according to the university goal card realization rates. Distributable Reward Amount: The amount that shows the total maximum reward that the university can pay to its employees in the relevant performance period, calculated by multiplying the “Reward Pool” amount by the “Reward Pool Multiplier”. Total Annual Gross Wage: Total gross base wage and gross bonus actually paid to the employee in the relevant performance period. Rules 1. APPLICATION PRINCIPLES 1.1. General Principles Performance Reward defined within the scope of this regulation is not defined as an acquired right and is not an integral part of the salary. Reward is valid for the relevant year depending on the annual performance results and the decision to make the payments is at the initiative of the Board of Trustees. The targets, lower and upper limits that form the basis of the reward are created by the University Executive Board from among the KPIs monitored by the Board of Trustees in the University strategic plan each year. It is reviewed by the relevant committees and submitted to the approval of the Board of Trustees. After the approval of the Board of Trustees, President and General Secretary Goal Cards are created and the targets of all administrative employees (President’s Office for Academic staff, General Secretariat for Administrative staff) with indefinite term contracts are distributed. The “University Goal Card” realizations and the bonus rates that will form the basis of the bonus and are based on the employee levels are put into practice for the employees after the preliminary approval of the Audit and Finance Committees and the approval of the Board of Trustees at the end of the evaluation period. The decision to make a performance reward payment in the following two cases is subject to the evaluation and discretion of the Board of Trustees: The Financing Plan target is realized below the minimum target determined in the University goal card each year and approved by the Finance Committee and the Board of Trustees respectively The “University Goal Card” realization result is below the approved minimum target A sample University Goal Card and the approval system of KPIs are given below: 1.2. Performance Targets The results of the targets and KPIs determined in parallel with the University's goal card, which are used as the basis for the performance reward calculation, are calculated by applying the performance evaluation system defined in the University's Performance Instruction Letter. 1.3. Performance Reward Rates The performance reward rates corresponding to individual performance scores are determined as follows. If the individual performance score is below 70, the relevant employees will not be paid a performance reward. Reward rates for intermediate values ​​between 70 and 200 are calculated by taking into account the individual performance evaluation results. 1.4. Determination and Approval of the Reward Pool Multiplier The reward pool multiplier is determined based on the University Goal Card result approved by the Board of Trustees and according to the reward pool multiplier ranges shown in the table below. Interim realizations are calculated linearly in line with the rates specified in the table. 1.5. Calculation of the Reward Amount That Can Be Distributed The Total Reward Amount That Can Be Distributed is determined by increasing/decreasing the “Reward Pool” amount with the “Reward Pool Multiplier”. 1.6. Determination of the Reward Pool The reward pool is the total amount calculated within the framework of other calculation variables (permanent salary totals, promotion/assignment/level changes and periodic reward rates) within the year, assuming that the individual performance scores of all employees within the scope of performance reward are “100”. The reward pool calculation includes all permanent administrative employees within the scope of performance reward and who are still working at the university as of the reward payment date. Reward pool calculations are made by Human Resources before performance reward payments. 1.7. Determination of the Amount of Reward That Can Be Distributed If the university is entitled to reward in accordance with the general principles specified in Article 1.1, the reward pool that can be distributed, which shows the maximum performance reward that can be distributed to the employees within the scope of performance reward, is calculated by increasing/decreasing the “reward pool” amount with the “reward pool multiplier”. For all employees within the scope of performance reward, the total reward amount to be paid cannot be more than the reward amount that can be distributed, but can be less. 1.8. Calculation of Individual Reward Amount The variables affecting the calculation of individual performance reward amount are as follows: Individual Performance Score Approved Reward Rate by Level Total Annual Gross Salary Distributable Reward Pool All performance reward payments are determined in accordance with the general principles specified in Article 1.1 of this document. Individual reward entitlement calculation is made in accordance with these variables as follows; “Individual Performance Score” is calculated for each employee as explained in 1.2. The individual “Reward Rate” explained in 1.3 is found for each employee from the employee’s “Job Level” and “Individual Performance Score”. The “Individual Reward Amount” is found by multiplying the calculated “Reward Rate” with the “Total Annual Gross Salary” amount. The “Total Individual Reward Amount” calculated for all employees within the scope is checked and finalized according to the University’s “Reward Amount That Can Be Distributed”. 1.9. University Goal Card The goal card, which will serve the main goal of contributing to society by reaching a position where the university will make a global difference with a sustainable structure and innovative solutions, is structured in four perspectives. Financial Sustainability Research / Innovation Leadership in the Academic Field People, Organizational Excellence and Sustainability 1.10. President and Secretary General Goal Card The goal cards of the President and Secretary General are created in parallel with the University goal card, which will serve the main goal of contributing to society by reaching a position where the university will make a global difference with a sustainable structure and innovative solutions. 1.11. Employee Movements 1.11.1. Starting Work An employee who starts working in a position within the scope of the reward on or after September 01 will be included in the reward plan as of the following year. 1.11.2. Promotion/Assignment or Rank Change For an employee who is within the scope of performance reward and whose target performance reward rate and/or targets change due to a title and/or rank change, the performance reward amount for the period before the change date and the performance reward amount for the period after the change date are calculated separately. 1.11.3. Leaves The periods spent by the employee on annual paid leave and legal excuse leave and the days legally considered as worked are considered as worked in the calculation of the reward entitlement. 1.11.4. Termination of the Employment Contract 1.11.4.1. Termination of the Employment Contract for Reasons Other Than Acts Contrary to the Rules of Ethics and Good Faith (25-II) or upon Agreement of the Parties In order for employees to be entitled to the award payment, it is essential that they are working at the university on the date of payment. In the event that the employment contract is terminated by the employee (worker), the employee cannot have any request regarding the award payment. However, after the period constituting the basis for the award ends and until the date of the award payments, the decision to make an award payment to employees whose employment contract is terminated for a reason other than the justified reasons specified in Article 25-II of the Labor Law No. 4857 (Acts Contrary to the Rules of Ethics and Good Faith) or is terminated by mutual agreement, provided that they meet the other conditions specified in this instruction letter, is left to the discretion of the Secretary General. The decision to make an award payment to employees whose employment contract is terminated for a reason other than the justified reasons specified in Article 25-II of the Labor Law No. 4857 (Acts Contrary to the Rules of Ethics and Good Faith) until the date of the award payments is made is left to the discretion of the Secretary General. In case of termination as per 25-II (Acts Contrary to the Rules of Ethics and Good Faith), the employee will not have any entitlement regarding the reward application. 1.11.4.2. Termination of the Employment Contract for a Reason Other Than Legal Termination In the event that the employment contract is terminated due to the employee's death, disability or inability to continue working due to health reasons, payments are made to the person or their legal heirs, provided that the other conditions specified in this document are met. 1.11.4.3. Cancellation and Refund of Performance Reward Payments (Malus & Clawback) The performance reward system is based on rewarding the strong performance and success of the university. However, the method of achieving these goals is as decisive as these goals in the calculation of entitlements. Accordingly, performance reward amounts become partially or completely invalid in the event of the following situations: The employee acts contrary to the Sabancı University Code of Ethics, The employee abuses their duty or makes false statements, The employee is involved in an incident that significantly damages the reputation of the University or is responsible for it, Violation of the Employment Contract, Confidentiality Agreement and/or Exit Agreements made with the employee The employee uses and/or shares confidential information/documents etc. that they possess due to their duties during the period they work at the university after leaving the university A significant error occurs in the calculation of the realization values ​​of the targets used to determine the results of the performance reward calculations. In the event that such behaviors/activities are detected, the University Board of Trustees may, at its discretion, decide to cancel/reduce the reward for the period that has not yet been earned and has not yet been paid (Malus) and/or to take back the rewards that have been paid within the framework of the Labor Law and relevant legal regulations (Clawback). From the moment the employee is included in the performance reward plan, they are deemed to have accepted all the articles in this document and its annexes. 1.12. Status of the Reward System The performance reward defined in this document cannot be defined as an acquired right and is not an integral part of the wage. The realization of any plan entitlement payment in any period does not transform the performance reward application into an acquired right status and does not guarantee that the reward system will continue in the following periods. 2. REVIEW This document shall enter into force as of the date of its approval and shall be reviewed at least once a year under the responsibility of the Human Resources Directorate. If deemed necessary, it may be revised in line with the changes made in the process. In case of an update, the necessary approval processes shall be completed and announced to all employees via the internal portal."
