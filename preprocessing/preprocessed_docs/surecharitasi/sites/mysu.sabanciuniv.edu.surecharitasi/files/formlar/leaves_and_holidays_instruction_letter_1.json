Basis Labor Law No. 4857, Annual Paid Leave Regulation Definitions / Abbreviations SU: Sabancı University SG: Secretary General HR: Human Resources Staff Member: Administrative or academic staff member Unit Manager: President / Vice President / Dean / Secretary General / Director / Manager, depending on the position of the staff member SGK: Social Security Institution Rules GENERAL Academic Staff Members 1. Academic staff members make their annual leave plans at the beginning of the calendar year (until January 15) for the entire leave of the relevant year, fill out an electronic leave form, and submit it to the relevant faculty dean for approval. They revise the changes that occur during the year through the system. Actual leave dates are recorded and signed in the signature book under the coordination of Human Resources at the end of the year. Leave not taken until the beginning of August is planned and used under the coordination of the relevant faculty dean, starting from the second week of August until the end of the first week of September. 2. It is essential for academic staff to use their annual leave during the summer and semester breaks. In cases of necessity, short annual leave can be taken during the semester, provided that classes are not disrupted. In this case, the staff member declares their reason to their manager along with the leave form. 3. Electronic permission forms approved by the Dean are valid. If the actual leave dates and planned leave dates are different, the employee must fill out an electronic Leave Correction Form via the workflow application and complete the work steps. 4. It is the responsibility of the relevant Dean to ensure that the electronic leave forms are filled out before the leave and an electronic Leave Correction Form is sent via the workflow application by the employee if necessary after returning from leave. Administrative Staff Members 1. Administrative staff members inform their managers about the dates they plan to use annual leave at the beginning of the calendar year. It is essential that the earned leave be used within the relevant year. A leave plan is created by obtaining the approval of the relevant manager, along with unused leave from previous years, if any. 2. Before going on leave, staff members must fill out the electronic Leave Form and complete the work steps through the workflow application. 3. Electronic permission forms approved by the Unit Manager and HR are valid. If the actual leave dates and planned leave dates are different, the staff member must fill out an electronic Leave Correction Form via the workflow application and complete the work steps. 4. It is the responsibility of the relevant Unit Manager to ensure that the electronic leave forms are filled out before the leave and an electronic Leave Correction Form is sent via the workflow application by the employee if necessary after returning from leave. 5. The person who is on leave must designate, together with the Relevant Unit Manager, a person to replace them while on leave, in order to avoid disruption of work. A. Annual Leave: 1. According to the labor law, in order to qualify for leave, it is necessary to complete one year of work at SU. Before the entitlement period for annual paid leave expires (before the completion of a working year), advance leave may be granted upon the employee's request, with the approval of their manager. The maximum amount of advance leave that can be used within a year is the amount of annual paid leave that will be earned within a year. If the employment relationship continues, the advance leave granted will be offset against the annual leave to be earned in the following period. If the employment relationship ends before the employee is entitled to annual leave, the pay for the advance leave period will be deducted from their receivables. If their receivables are not sufficient or they do not have any receivables, the employee will deposit the advance leave fee in one lump sum to the University's salary account on the day they leave work. Detailed and up-to-date information regarding these transactions should be obtained from the Human Resources Unit - Payroll employees. 2. For each year worked at SU, the right to annual leave is obtained in accordance with the following conditions: i. Academic Staff: 30 calendar days ii. Administrative staff: Employees under the age of fifty: Employees aged fifty and over: 3. In accordance with the law, annual paid leave can be used partially, with the agreement of the parties, and a part of the leave cannot be less than 10 days. 4. Part-time employees are also entitled to leave when their (1) year of service is completed and the above leave periods apply. However, part-time employees can take leave for at least one week. For example, if a part-time employee who works only on Wednesdays wants to take leave on Wednesday, they will fill out a leave form for January 1-7 and will not work on the Wednesday that falls between January 1-7. 6 days will be deducted from the person's annual paid leave balance. 5. While calculating annual paid leave, services provided in other Sabancı Group companies are taken into account as if they had worked at SU when calculating the leave rights, if the person started working at SU without a break. 6. In calculating the leave, Saturdays are considered as working days. However, if one-day annual leave is taken on Friday, Saturday is not counted as annual leave. 7. Personnel who are on annual leave cannot be forced to work on the days they are on leave. 8. National holidays and public holidays that coincide with the annual leave period are not counted as leave periods when calculating annual paid leave. 9. Personnel who will spend their annual leave in a place other than where the workplace is located can be given a maximum of 7 calendar days of unpaid leave to cover the time spent on the road if they wish. When annual leave is used by splitting it in half, the number of unpaid leave days is not extended. 10. If the staff member who falls ill during their annual paid leave brings a report issued by SGK hospitals or an institution accepted by SGK, the sick days will not be deducted from the annual paid leave. 11. SU encourages its employees to use their annual leave regularly every calendar year. 12. No salary is paid for unused leave. The dates when the institution declares compulsory administrative leave/bridge leave are deducted from the annual leave. B. Sick Leave: a. Short-term sick leave: If the employee is unable to work due to a non-work-related illness or injury and cannot attend work for a period of up to a week (7 consecutive calendar days), short-term sick leave is applied. 1. The salary of the staff is paid during the leave. 2. In case of illness lasting up to 2 days, the relevant Unit Manager may request a medical report from the SGK doctor or a private doctor, if deemed necessary. In case of illness lasting more than 2 days, a medical report must be submitted. If the report cannot be obtained on the date of return to work or if the report is found to be fake, the University has the right to take legal action. 3. Documents proving a staff member’s incapacity to work obtained from a SGK doctor or an institution approved by SGK must be submitted to HR within 3 business days following the end of the rest period. The report must be entered into the SGK system by the University within the mentioned period. Otherwise, a fine is imposed by SGK. b. Long-term sick leave: If the employee cannot work due to a non-work-related illness or injury and cannot come to work for a period of one week to six months, long-term sick leave is applied. 1. Personnel must provide medical reports and medical documents obtained from a public or private hospital within the first three weeks of absence from work. If they cannot provide the necessary documents within this period, the number of days they do not come to work will be considered as unpaid leave. 2. Failure to provide medical reports may result in termination of employment. 3. The part of the health report period up to the employee's \"notice period + 6 weeks\" on that date is deemed as time worked for the purpose of annual leave calculation, the remaining period is deemed as time not worked and is not included in the annual unpaid leave calculation. c. Serious Illness Leave: What is meant by serious illness is a serious health condition lasting more than six months that involves the staff documenting their inability to work resulting from inpatient treatment in a hospital or healthcare facility. If the person's inability to work is expected to last longer than six months, their employment agreement may be terminated. C. Maternity Leave: 1. Upon the request of the pregnant employee and upon submission of a doctor's report (from the SGK doctor or a private doctor) stating the planned date of birth, paid leave is granted for the eight weeks before the planned birth date and the eight weeks after the birth. In case of multiple pregnancies, two more weeks are added to the eight-week prenatal leave period. 2. If the leave to be taken before the planned birth date will exceed eight weeks due to health reasons, an additional report must be obtained from a general hospital or maternity hospital in addition to the doctor's report stating the planned birth date. 3. Temporary illness or inability to work caused by pregnancy or birth is covered within the scope of sick leave. 4. During the eight-week prenatal period, a pregnant employee can work up to 3 weeks before birth upon their own request and with a doctor's report, if their health condition is appropriate. The time worked is added to the postpartum leave period. 5. One of the spouses or the employee who adopts a child under the age of three is granted eight weeks of maternity leave, starting from the date the child is actually delivered to the family. 6. The mother is given breastfeeding leave for a total of 1.5 hours a day until the child turns one year old. The mother determines the hours between which this time will be used and how it will be divided, in agreement with their Manager. The mother may wish to accumulate this daily leave and use it weekly. The mother must consult the Unit Manager to arrange breastfeeding leave. 7. In accordance with the Labor Law, there is no obligation to pay salary to the employee during maternity leave. However, as a policy, SU pays its employees full salary during maternity leave. There is an offset agreement between the university and SGK. If SGK makes incapacity payments to employee accounts, the Human Resources - Payroll unit should be contacted. 8. Female employees are given unpaid leave for up to 6 months upon request after completion of maternity leave. This period shall not be taken into account in calculating the entitlement to paid annual leave. As a principle, it is essential to use maternity leave first, then annual paid leave, if any, and lastly unpaid leave. D. Excused Leave: 1. Excused leave is granted under the following conditions: 2. 2. In other cases where the employee needs to deal with private affairs or problems, the Unit Manager may grant excused leave for 6 days a year. The employee must complete the process by filling out the electronic form for excused leave. This leave is generally given for (1) day if needed and cannot be used collectively. If it is determined that the excused leave is used for purposes other than its intended purpose, this leave is considered as annual leave. E. Unpaid Leave: 1. SU may give its employees unpaid leave for educational purposes or special reasons. 2. Unpaid leave is given by the decision of the Dean and President for faculty members, and by the decision of the Unit Manager and SG for administrative staff. 3. If the unpaid leave request is for education or development purposes, the requirement is to complete at least three years of service at SU. For reasons other than education, this period can be evaluated and reduced to one year. 4. Leave cannot exceed one year. 5. Leave will not be granted unless the necessary arrangements are made in advance to ensure that the responsibilities of the administrative staff and the teaching, research, and administrative duties of the faculty member are carried out without disruption. 6. Leave requests must be notified one semester in advance by faculty members and one month in advance by administrative staff, and the exact dates on which leave will be taken must be specified in the request. 7. Benefit programs of the university member who is on unpaid leave are suspended during this period. 8. An employee who does not return to the University within (3) business days without giving any reason after taking unpaid leave, loses their future employment rights and is deemed to have terminated their contract due to absence. 9.Unpaid leave is not counted as time worked when calculating annual paid leave. The number of leave days corresponding to the non-working period (if the total is longer than 30 days) is deducted from the number of earned leave days of the relevant year. Periods spent on unpaid leave are considered unworked in the calculation of the service period required to qualify for 20 days or 26 days of leave. 10.For unpaid leave, the employee fills out an electronic Leave Form via the workflow application. They send their signed petition stating the reason for their request for unpaid leave and the dates between which they want to be on unpaid leave, to HR after having it approved by their Unit Manager.
