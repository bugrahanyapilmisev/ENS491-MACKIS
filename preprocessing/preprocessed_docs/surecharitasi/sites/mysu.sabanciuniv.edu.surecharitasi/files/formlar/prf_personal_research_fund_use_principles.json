  "text": "PRF (Personal Research Fund) USE PRINCIPLES Expenditures that can be made within the scope of PRF: The PRF budget can be spent on items that may be necessary for the research of PRF users such as Book and journal purchase expenses Domestic and international travel expenses, conference, seminar, etc. participation expenses and visa expenses required for these travels Consumables expenses such as laboratory equipment, cartridge, internet, etc. Membership fees to scientific and professional organizations and printing expenses for scientific articles Fixed asset purchases Student support expenses Personal needs that are not related to research cannot be met from the PRF budget. Evaluation of expenditure content is under the authority of the Dean/Unit Director. PRF budget can be used in the September-August academic term. PRF budget amount remaining from an academic term cannot be transferred to the new term. Documentation of PRF Use: All documents such as invoices, flight tickets, etc. for all expenses within the scope of PRF (including overseas expenses) must be issued in the name of the university with the following information: SABANCI UNIVERSITY Orta Mah. Üniversite Cad. No: 27 34956 Tuzla/Istanbul/Türkiye Tuzla Tax Office: 736 007 8450 Invoices issued in the name of a person cannot be accepted. Since the payment document and order document cannot be used instead of an invoice, documents such as invoices, e-tickets, etc. for the expense must be provided. All expenses are deducted from the PRF budget including VAT. During the purchase request/order, this information and the remaining PRF budget amount should be taken into consideration and the expense should be planned accordingly. Invoices issued to foundation universities within the scope of VAT withholding must first be delivered to the Financial Affairs Unit (FA) as soon as possible with the form (In invoices with VAT withholding, it is important to have the PRF user's name and surname along with the PRF expression written in the explanation or footnote part on the invoice). All domestic and international invoices must be delivered to the FA to be recorded in the legal books within the same month as the invoice date or at the latest in the first week of the month following the invoice date, as required by the periodicity principle of accounting. If the international trips are long-term, it is important to share the closing documents (invoice, receipt, etc.) with the FA within 1 week at the latest after the return date. For all domestic and international trips, the Travel and Ticket Form under SUFORM must be filled out before the trip. This form is important for announcing and approving the trip. PRF refund cannot be made with this form. For all flights, electronic tickets must be declared together with the boarding passes. For flights purchased from abroad, an invoice must be obtained from the company that includes the SU invoice information, since there are no applicable financial e-tickets (if it is to be purchased through an agency, it must be purchased by the travel agency that the University has an agreement with). In cases where an invoice cannot be obtained, bus or train tickets should be in the name of the user. In cases where international travel expenses are involved, the rules of the Financial and Accounting Management Instruction Letter (IFA-S340-01)/Domestic/International Travel Expenses Procedure (PFA-S340-03) shall be followed. The full daily allowance (per diem) amount in the Financial and Accounting Management Instruction Letter shall be calculated. Half-daily allowance shall also be calculated based on this (Daily allowance is the amount calculated on a daily basis that covers the main living expenses of the personnel during a trip. The personnel cover their daily expenses such as accommodation, food, taxi, vehicle rental, etc. by staying within this amount.). Visa expenses required for overseas events, conferences, etc. to be attended by PRF users must be declared with the relevant event/conference invitation document and then the participation document. PRF users may provide PRF support (flight ticket, conference participation fee, cash) to a SU student to participate in and support an academic/artistic project/research that includes an application (practice) that will reinforce their development. Support expenses to be made must be included in the Closure Process with documents to be received on behalf of SU. In cases where student support is provided in cash, the “Student Support Form” must be filled out and the receipt showing the payment must be attached to the PRF form. For payments (consultancy etc.) to be made to individuals who cannot issue invoices (except for student support payments made to SU students), an expense slip is issued by the FA. The current Income Tax and VAT determined by the government are calculated and deducted from the PRF budget and processed. A petition including the identity card or passport copy, address information, amount paid, and the work/service for which the payment was made, including the signature of the person to whom the payment was made, must be submitted to the FA. Fixed asset purchases are made if the Faculty Dean/Unit Director approves it. The “Institutional Fixed Asset Management Instruction Letter (IFA-S320-01)” is taken into consideration in terms of ownership, possession, and usage of fixed assets. Purchases such as computers and tablets are made through the Procurement Unit by informing the Information Technologies Unit, provided that the Faculty Dean/Unit Director approves it, by justifying the need, and such purchases cannot be made through the PRF Closure Process. For these purchases, the “Institutional Fixed Asset Management Instruction Letter (IFA-S320-01)” is also applied. IT products (computers, tablets, hardware, etc.) to be purchased within the scope of the PRF will be in compliance with the rules and definitions in the “Hardware and Software Procurement Procedure (PIT-S130-0123)”. Exceptional cases are subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean/Unit Director. All documents declared for PRF closure (except purchases made through procurement requests) are deemed to have been paid for by the user. The addressee of any “not paid” claim from the seller is the PRF user. If SU suffers a loss due to such a claim, this loss is collected from the PRF user. If an expenditure is made in a currency other than TL within the scope of PRF, the relevant expenditure is converted into the currency to be applied using the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey’s exchange rate as of the document date. For this reason, it should be checked that the expenditure document date is entered correctly in SUFORM. A form can be filled out via SUForm until August 31 at the latest for the said expenditures. PRF form expenditure documents must be submitted to the Financial Affairs Unit no later than the first week of September. PRF Spending Rules: Three methods are used for spending: Payment against spending documents, where the user makes a payment to the vendor in return for the product/service received, forwards it to the FA with the spending and payment documents, and requests a refund. An advance request is made and payment is received, the expenses are covered by this advance and paid. Then, the advance is closed by filling out the form with the spending and payment documents. Purchases can be made from the PRF budget through a request through the Procurement Unit. Instead of the PRF user, the SU makes the purchase, and the payment is sent to the vendor by deducting it from the PRF budget (This method is mandatory for products such as laptops, chairs, etc., and can be preferred for other purchases). Plane tickets purchased by selecting an authorized agency with the Travel and Ticket Form can be paid to the vendor by deducting it from the budget if the user does not prefer to make a payment. Payment against spending documents: The PRF user keeps the invoices and payment documents of the expenses they have made. The PRF Closure Process is filled out via SUFORM. Expense item is selected for each expense. When this document is recorded in the system, a liability number is created. The form is printed, signed by the Dean/Unit Director together with the documents and sent to the FA. When the FA processes the PRF form, it sends an automatic e-mail stating that the transaction has been taken into the payment/advance closure process. The FA creates a PRF payment list and sends it to the Finance Unit. After the payment, the Finance Unit sends an automatic e-mail to the PRF user regarding the payment notification. Advance Request: PRF users who want to receive an advance from their PRF fill out the PRF Advance Process via SUFORM for each advance request. The system performs a budget check and assigns a pre-liability number to the process. In the first advance application of the year, a maximum of 1/3 of the annual total PRF amount notified to users by the relevant Faculty Dean/Unit Director can be given as an advance. After the approval of the Dean/Unit Director, the FA makes the advance payment if appropriate based on the PRF Use Principles. After closing the first advance received, the PRF user will be able to receive half of the remaining balance, and after closing that portion, the last remaining balance as an advance. However, the advance received each time cannot exceed 1/3 of the total annual amount. If the requested advance payment amount exceeds 1/3 of the annual amount, the advance payment is submitted to the Dean/Unit Director for approval by the FA and the payment is made accordingly. This rate is applied as 1/2 for those who start working after February 1 and are entitled to PRF. If the amount of acceptable expenses is greater than the amount of advance received, the difference between the expense amount and the total advance is paid to the person considering their budget. The FA carries out the necessary process for the excess or deficiency of the advance by consulting with the PRF user. If there is an invalid document, it returns it to the PRF user with a justification. It is essential that PRF advances that are not closed within two months from the date of receipt are deducted from the third month's salary. A new advance cannot be requested without closing the previous PRF advance. The last advance received within the scope of the annual total PRF amount must also be closed by August 10 at the latest. PRF advances that are not closed are collected by deducting from the September salary. If the PRF user leaves the job, changes their role, or moves to a position in which they are not entitled to PRF, the documentable portion of the advance payment received is deducted from the PRF advance payment. The undocumentable portion is collected from the user by deducting it from their salary. In order to close the expenses made in return for the advance payment, the PRF user fills out the PRF Closure Process. The form is printed out, signed by the Dean/Unit Director along with the documents, and sent to the FA. These procedures are repeated for each advance payment closing. In terms of accounting periodicity and reporting accuracy, PRF forms that do not reach the FA within one month (starting from the date the closure process is filled in) or at the latest by the end of the first week of the following month, and are only filled out through the system without any physical documents and signature, are cancelled. If the documents cannot be delivered to the FA within a short time, it is recommended not to create a form through the system. After the advance and closing transactions, the PRF user can view their PRF usage status on the page where they are to fill out a new form via SUFORM."
