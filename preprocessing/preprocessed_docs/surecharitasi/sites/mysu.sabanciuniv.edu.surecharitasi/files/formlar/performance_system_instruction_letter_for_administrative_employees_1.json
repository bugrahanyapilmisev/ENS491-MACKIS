Scope The performance system covers all permanent administrative employees. Principle Sabancı University attaches importance to the development of the competencies and performance of its employees. It carries out performance development with a participatory, objective and transparent approach. Basis Labor Law No. 4857, Labor Law No. 1475 and relevant legislation, Definitions / Abbreviations University: Sabancı University Calibration Committee: Consists of members of the University Executive Board. Administrator: The person who will conduct the performance planning and review of the permanent administrative staff. This person can be the President, General Secretary, Vice President, Dean, Director, Manager, or the Leader with subordinates. Employee: The person about whom the performance planning and review will be conducted. Rules 1. The period that forms the basis of the Performance System is a calendar year. At the beginning of each year, the work goals of all employees for the upcoming period are determined in a participatory manner, parallel to the goals of the university and the unit they are affiliated with, by taking the employee's opinions. The \"Goal Setting\" interviews of those who start a new job during the year should be held within the third month of the person's start and should be evaluated during the performance evaluation period determined by Human Resources at the end of the year. Employees who start after September 1 are not included in the performance evaluation of the current year. 2. The employee's goal setting at the beginning of the term, feedback and coaching throughout the term, and review at the end of the term are carried out by the employee's immediate manager and are reviewed and approved by the 2nd-level manager. The performance review of employees whose units and managers change during the year should be conducted by the new manager, but should be conducted by taking the opinions of the previous manager. Whenever possible, it is recommended that the review be carried out by both managers together. 3. The performance process consists of three parts: 1. Goal Setting 2. Continuous Performance (Review and Feedback) 3. Performance Evaluation At the beginning of the period, Managers share their goals with employees. Employees determine goals for the next period, agree with their managers, and enter them into the system. During the period, the manager monitors the employee's performance, interviews, and provides feedback. At the end of the period, a one-on-one \"Performance Evaluation Meeting\" is held with employees, and the employee's level of achievement of the goals set at the beginning of the period is evaluated. 4. Goal Setting: The university's goals are approved by the Board of Trustees. The President and the Secretary General cascade these goals to the VPs/Deans/Directors. Then, employees set their goals at the beginning of the term and agree with their managers on the goals to be achieved and the criteria by which success in achieving these goals will be evaluated. Goals should be ranked according to their importance and priority. The following should be taken into consideration during the goal-setting phase: Goals should be related to the university's goals and unit goals, Goals should be related to strategic goals, Goals should be related to the employee's duties and responsibilities, The number of goals should be minimum 5 and maximum 8, The minimum weight of the goals should be 10%, and the maximum weight should be 40%, Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, suitable for the university's goals, and timely, Although some goals may not be achieved/completed within a performance period, a goal should be defined, and the part that needs to be completed/achieved by the end of the term should be determined, and an evaluation should be made for this part. Likewise, goals expected to be completed before the end of the term should be evaluated on the date the goal should be completed before the end of the term. 5. Continuous Performance: After the 1st- and 2nd-level managers approve the goals entered by the employee through the system, the continuous performance period begins. Continuous performance covers the period in which goals are reviewed, feedback can be provided, and updated outside of the goal-setting period. In the event of significant changes in the business goals and priorities of the University and/or Unit during the continuous performance period until the evaluation period, goals can be updated if deemed necessary, new goals can be added, and existing goals can be canceled. When changes are made, a draft version is created in the system. The draft version must be sent again for the approval of the 1st- and 2nd-level managers. When the form is sent for approval, the employee cannot perform any action on the form awaiting approval. While the employee is in the continuous performance period, the achievements of completed goals can be entered into the system without waiting for the evaluation period. 6. Evaluation Period: The Year-End Performance Evaluation period is December. Unlike other periods, goals updates, goal suggestions, or associations cannot be made during the evaluation period. Summary information about the goals is listed, and the goals can only be viewed. At the end of the performance evaluation period, based on the employee's self-evaluations, the manager determines the appointments for the performance review meeting with all employees to whom goals have been cascaded. Based on the employee's evaluations, the 1st- and 2nd-level managers make their evaluations. After all evaluations are completed, the form should be sent for approval. All evaluations are reviewed by the Calibration Committee led by the President, the General Secretary, and Human Resources. When the evaluations are completed, employees can view their own scores on the Perfx screen. 7. Feedback and Coaching Throughout the Period: Providing feedback during the period is a prerequisite for successfully achieving the goals at the end of the period and is an important part of the Performance System. This should be accepted and implemented by both the Manager and the Employee. Feedback should be provided regularly by the Manager. The source of the feedback to be provided during the period will be the observations of the Manager, the observations of an immediate manager if any, and the feedback from all stakeholders (coworker, subordinate, superior, etc.) with whom the person interacts while performing their job. The Manager should receive formal or informal feedback about the Employee from various stakeholders throughout the period, evaluate the feedback they receive, and try to make it concrete. Feedback can be provided through the Perfx system, and feedback can also be requested from each stakeholder. 8. Performance Evaluation: A face-to-face meeting should be arranged with all employees for the evaluation at the end of the term, and an agreement should be reached with the employees. At the end of the term, a mutual evaluation is made on the performance goals agreed upon at the beginning of the term and reviewed during the term if necessary. 9. Evaluation of Success: Success in achieving the targets is determined by the base score of 70 and the ceiling score of 200. A score of 100 as a General Evaluation means that the employee has achieved all of their goals. In the general evaluation, the success in achieving the targets one by one and the importance and weight of the targets are taken into consideration. 10. Development Plan: Sabancı University attaches importance to training and development activities in order to develop the competencies and performance of its employees. For this purpose, after the goals are evaluated, the person's strengths and areas open to development are summarized. What the employee should do to develop themselves in the future is discussed. Here, training programs and development activities can be suggested for the employee. At this stage, suggestions can come from the Manager, or the Employee can come up with some suggestions. After this evaluation, a concrete action plan is made for the next year to ensure development. Appropriate actions for each development need and the date or time period in which they are expected to be realized should be specified. 11. Comments and Approval: The Manager forwards the completed Performance Evaluation Form to the next manager. In cases where the Manager and the employee do not agree, the Senior Manager, if deemed necessary, holds meetings with the employee and the manager and adds their own comments to the evaluation. The performance level is clarified as a result of the Senior Manager's evaluation. If the General Evaluation is below the target, the Manager's guidance / assistance plan is monitored by the Senior Manager."
