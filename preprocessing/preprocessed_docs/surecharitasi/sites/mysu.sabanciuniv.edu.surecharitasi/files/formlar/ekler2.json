Büyükdere Caddesi No.12 Levent 80613 İstanbul Dear Mrs.Kaçmaz, This is a full-block letter; every line of the letter begins at the left margin. Although using full-block style saves time in typing, the letterhead needs to be planned for it. Otherwise it might end up with a letter that does not have a balanced appearance. For example, a letterhead with printing on the left side of the page would present an awkward appearance if used with full-block style. A full-block letter cannot be double spaced. If several persons are to receive carbon copies, their names are listed after the carboncopy notation. They are listed either by rank or in alphabetical order. Yours very truly, Robert T. Walker Director Encl. Map Note: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx cc: Mr..Mehmet Kulan"
