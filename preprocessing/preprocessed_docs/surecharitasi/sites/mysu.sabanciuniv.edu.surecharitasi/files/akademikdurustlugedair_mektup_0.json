  "text": "We have been working to change the culture regarding academic dishonesty for the last several years and have come to the conclusion that much more effort is needed. We must have a unified approach. Establishment of this cultural change will take many years and it requires commitment from all of us. In order to minimize the discrepancies of how academic integrity violations are dealt with across and within faculties, we are moving to a new model. In the attached file it is underlined that \"the main instructor personally reports all incidences with preponderance of evidence for violations of academic integrity, without exceptions, to the Dean or the Director's office.\" It is also stated that the academic integrity policy for each course is appended to the syllabus and announced to the students at the beginning of the course. The situation regarding academic integrity is going to be reviewed once a year in a meeting of the Deans' Board. A record of the year's Academic Integrity applications, including selec ted cases and statistics, is issued by the Board after this meeting and publicized prominently over the internal web site. The report protects the privacy and anonymity of the persons involved. The Director of Student Resources implements the publication. Please carefully read the attached file with name \"academicintegrity.doc\" for details of the implementation. Please report any violations of academic integrity to your dean/director by filling out the attached form with name \"violation log.xls\". For disciplinary procedures please refer to Student Discipline Instruction Letter ISR-C210-01 Student Discipline Procedure PSR-C210-0101"
