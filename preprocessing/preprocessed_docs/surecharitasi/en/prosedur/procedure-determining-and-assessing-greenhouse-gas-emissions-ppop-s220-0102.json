Scope This procedure encompasses all activities related to the determination and evaluation of Sabancı University's greenhouse gas emissions and the reporting of these calculations. Definitions / Abbreviations SU: Sabancı University POP: Procurement and Operations Directorate Unit Sustainability Manager: Procurement and Operations Directorate Sustainability Unit Manager Greenhouse Gas: A gaseous component of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that is absorbed and emitted by the Earth, atmosphere, and clouds at specific wavelengths within the infrared radiation spectrum. Greenhouse Gas Source: A physical unit or process that releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse Gas Emission: The total mass of a greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere over a given period. Direct Greenhouse Gas Emission: Greenhouse Gas Emission from greenhouse gas sources owned or controlled by an organization. Greenhouse Gas Emission fro Energy: Greenhouse Gas Emission generated during the production of electricity, heat, or steam supplied and consumed by an organization. Other Indirect Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions from GHG sources owned or controlled by other organizations as a result of an organization's activities, other than energy-indirect GHG emissions. Greenhouse Gas Inventory: Information regarding an organization's GHG sources, GHG sinks, GHG emissions, and GHG removals. Greenhouse Gas Report: A standalone document prepared to communicate an organization's or project's GHG information to its intended users. Global Warming Potential (GWP): A factor defining the mass-based radiative impact of a specific GHG in carbon dioxide equivalents over a specified time period. Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2e): A unit used to compare the radiative intensity of a GHG to that of carbon dioxide. (The carbon dioxide equivalent is obtained by multiplying the mass of a given GHG by its global warming potential.) Baseline Year: A historical period for which GHG emissions or removals, or other GHG-related information, can be compared in the future. (Baseline year emissions or removals can be calculated based on a specific time period (one year) or the average of several time periods.) Organization: A public or private company, firm, entrepreneur, institution, or establishment, or all or part of these, with or without its own operations and management, partnerships. DEFRA: GHG Emission Factors Guide Implementation Steps Responsibility Outputs -Timing At SU, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions inventory is coordinated, audited, and monitored. All data is collected, managed, and recorded for the calculation of emissions. Sustainability Manager Once a year Possible disruptions in determining on-campus emissions are identified and their potential impact on emissions calculations are assessed. The frequency of occurrence of identified risks is recorded. Sustainability Manager Environmental Consultant Once a year Personnel involved in the Greenhouse Gas Monitoring process are informed, ensuring data flow and security. Sustainability Manager Environmental Consultant Once a year Natural gas invoice and meter verification are conducted through backup meters and cross-checked with values provided by the natural gas distribution company. Monthly calibration values for the main natural gas meter are obtained from the natural gas distribution company. This includes all natural gas consumption in m3 for each meter at the SU location between January 1st and December 31st of the year. Mechanical Works Manager Once a year The amount of fuel consumed by generators at the SU Operations Center is included. Consumption data is obtained from inventory tracking records and covers the period between January 1st and December 31st. The amount of fuel purchased for generator consumption during the relevant year (invoice/delivery note) is the supporting document. Mechanical Works Manager Once a year Inventory management, fuel level control, and the creation of procurement requests are ensured, as are diesel consumption amounts tracked and recorded. Mechanical Works Manager Once a year Theoretical calculations are made using catalog information obtained from the supplier, including fuel consumption by the diesel fire pumps at SU, the frequency of fire pump operation, and the pump's hourly fuel consumption. Mechanical Works Manager Sustainability Manager Once a year Electricity bill and meter verification is performed through a backup meter and cross-checked with values provided by the electricity distribution company. All electricity consumption in kWh for each meter on campus between January 1st and December 31st of the year is used in the calculations. A supporting document (invoice) showing the consumption in kWh for each meter at the facility will be recorded. If the purchased electricity holds a renewable energy certificate (I-REC, YEK-G, etc.), this certificate must also be recorded. Electrical Works Manager Sustainability Manager Once a year The calculation is based on the liters of diesel/gasoline consumed by the construction equipment used at SU (tractors, lawn mowers, etc. used for landscaping). The amount of fuel purchased during the relevant year (invoice/delivery note) is used as supporting documentation. Services Sustainability Manager Once a year This document covers the fuel consumption of SU senior management personnel vehicles between January 1st and December 31st of the year. Invoices issued by the supplier serve as supporting documentation in this regard. These documents include the date, quantity (liters), and fuel type information for the relevant departments. Services Sustainability Manager Once a year All devices containing refrigerant within the scope of the SU are recorded: their type, location within the SU, refrigerant capacity in kg, and refrigerant type. If refrigerant-containing devices have been refilled within the calculation year, supporting documentation such as invoices/delivery notes is provided as proof. Services Once a year Gases that cause GHG emissions (HFC227, CO2, etc.) in firefighting equipment and systems are included in the inventory. All devices, their location within the SU, their gas capacity in kg, and gas type are recorded. Firefighting equipment gases are included in the GHG calculations as CO2 and FM200. Mechanical Works Manager Services Once a year Indirect emissions from transportation (well to tank) are included in the inventory, including fuels, packaging transportation, raw material transportation, and waste transportation. Services Procurement Once a year Calculations are made using information on routes used, distance traveled (km), and number of trips for transportation of personnel to and from campus during the relevant calculation year. Services Once a year Records are kept of the total amount of water consumed and treated during the year. Water bills are also kept as record documents. Mechanical Works Manager Sustainability Manager Once a year Data for Category 1 and Category 2 is processed in \"kg,\" \"L,\" or \"kWh.\" Therefore, consumption amounts collected in different units are calculated using DEFRA's density coefficients. Data for Categories 3, 4, 5, and 6 are processed in \"kWh,\" \"L,\" \"ton.km,\" \"km,\" \"ton,\" and \"m3,\" and unit conversions are made for the relevant emission factors. Greenhouse Gas Emission Amount (CO2e) = (Consumption Amount) x (Emission Factor) Sustainability Manager Once a year Related Forms Related Form Links"
