It is intended to prevent the University's reputation from being negatively impacted by misuse, to ensure a consistent perception, to serve as a primary source of information on this matter, and to link it to other institutional identity practices. Scope This document covers all correspondence, written and visual materials produced by all academic and administrative units of the University, as well as all student units (Student Union, Student Clubs, etc.), for various events they plan, including all articles, publications, brochures, invitations, and other written and visual materials, and all communications, objects, and items (including electronic and other print applications) intended to bear the University logo and name. Principle All correspondence, written and visual materials, and items representing Sabancı University must comply with the basic elements and conditions set forth in the Sabancı University Institutional Identity Guide and Communications Guide. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations Definitions / Abbreviations General Approval: This is a one-time approval obtained from the Marketing and Institutional Communications Unit for materials that require continuous production and use (such as business cards, headers, attendance sheets, and envelopes). Regulations Registration: The Sabancı University name and logo are registered and may not be used without permission. Legal action will be taken against those who use them without permission. 1. Compliance with the conditions specified in the Sabancı University Institutional Identity Guide and the Institutional Communications Guide is mandatory for the following : • Basic Elements: Logo, Color, and Font • Printed Materials: Headers, attendance sheets, envelopes, business cards, notepads, fax paper, invitations, folders, announcements, etc. • Identity Cards • On-Vehicle Applications • Directional Signs • Flags 2. Fundamental Elements: The fundamental elements that define the University's institutional identity are the University's logo and font. 2.1. The rules defined in the Logo Guide must be meticulously applied to all materials on which the logo will be used. In all applications, the logo's dimensions and proportions must be considered. The dots of the letters \"Ü\" and the second and third \"i\" in the logo are offset from the letter bodies by specific dimensions and angles, giving it a distinct \"feature.\" Care must be taken to preserve this distinctive character throughout the logo's use. Conditions for the use of the logo in special applications not covered by the Guide are specified in Articles 4 and 5 of this instruction letter. The logo must be legible at all times. 2.2. The color that constitutes the Sabancı University institutional identity is navy blue (Pantone 280). In principle, the logo should be used in navy blue on white and light-colored backgrounds. The rules for using the logo on dark backgrounds are outlined in the Sabancı University Communication Guide. (This guide has been prepared as a digital copy and published on the www.sabanciuniv.edu website, under the \"Media\" section.) Except for newspaper prints, additional colors will be used in the logo during the printing process, and in newspaper prints, the logo's color will be subtracted from the trichromacy. In color prints, the color of the navy-blue rectangular background of the logo must not be changed under any circumstances. For black-and-white artwork, the logo will be printed on a black background. Screen toning will not be used. If photography is required on the background on which the logo will be applied, light-colored photographs should be selected. 2.3. To maintain the integrity of the University's identity in all printed materials, the font family specified in the Institutional Identity and Communication Guide must be used, depending on the medium. 2.4. Unit correspondence must use Sabon 10-point, black font or Times New Roman 11-point, black font. See: Font Standards Instruction Letter (IOP-S240-02) 3. Printed Materials, Identification Cards, On-Vehicle Applications, Directional Signs, and Flags: The set of rules for printed document design in the Guide must be strictly and unchangeably applied to all types of printed materials, especially to documents representing the University (header paper, attendance sheet, notepad, envelope), faxes, business cards, and announcements. Due care must be taken in this regard in all correspondence between units and those outside the University (texts, faxes, various promotional brochures, etc.). The Institutional Identity and Communication Guide must be taken as a basis for identity cards, vehicle-mounted applications, directional signs, and flag applications collectively produced by the University. When using the logo, particular attention must be paid to the logo's color, features, size, and proportions. All materials included in the guide that will incorporate the elements of the Institutional Identity must be produced under the supervision of the Marketing and Institutional Communications Unit. (See: Logo Usage Procedure (PMIC- S510 -0101 V02)). General approval is required for continuous materials (title paper, continuation sheet, envelope, flag, ID card, etc.). If materials requiring general approval are produced repeatedly, the responsibility rests with the unit commissioning the production. In this case, a copy must be submitted to the Marketing and Institutional Communications Unit after each production and before the relevant material is used. 4. Electronic Applications: When using the Sabancı University name and logo in all multimedia, web design, and electronic presentation materials, the rules specified in the Institutional Communications Unit must be adhered to. In addition to these rules, the image and impact of the electronic communication medium must be considered, and the colors and size of the logo must be adjusted accordingly. 5. Special Applications: Application examples that should be designed based on the institutional identity, but are used for non-standard, one-time, or special events or promotions (brochures, advertisements, promotional materials, items designed for commemorative/promotional/advertising purposes, mascots, etc.) are considered within the scope of the Institutional Communications Guide. Such special applications are planned and produced by the Marketing and Institutional Communications Unit (MIC) within the annual budget plan. MIC audits projects that are not included in the MIC budget plan, are not included in the MIC work plan due to needs arising during the year, and are carried out entirely independently for logo use and compliance with general rules. Approval must be obtained from MIC for the use of the university name and logo in these projects. (See: Logo Usage Procedure (PMIC- S510 -0101 V02)). Special applications for which the university logo and name may be used with approval are as follows: a) Designed and produced by the relevant units of the University; • Commemorative items and objects (e.g., the University mascot, various items such as t-shirts, caps, trophies, bookmarks, weights, badges, rings, etc. bearing the University logo), • Various written and visual materials used within the framework of academic and cultural events organized by academic units, • Promotional materials, brochures, invitations, and various written and visual materials prepared for a large-scale social/cultural event organized within the University (Graduation and various Opening Ceremonies, Tree Planting Festival, etc.), • Promotional materials, brochures, invitations, and various written and visual materials prepared for a large-scale academic/social/cultural event organized by the Student Union/Clubs, • Various written and visual materials to be used in activities such as special events at the University (career development events, fundraising campaigns, etc.), • Various written and visual promotional materials prepared for use in events organized by the University's Museum, EDU, IPM, SUNUM, and Kasa Gallery, etc. b) For events organized by the University in collaboration with external institutions, the University and other institutions jointly decide on the institutional integrity of the promotional materials to be prepared. This process is conducted under the guidance of the Communications Guide and with the supervision and approval of the MIC. 6. Sales for Profit: Students and employees are prohibited from selling any products or services on the University campus and/or using the facilities provided by the University for the purpose of generating revenue.
