Research Project Development and Management SUATT is responsible for the application, proposal, contract and execution processes of all research projects to which SU and Inovent are parties. SU supports national and international innovative and value-added research projects in line with its strategic goals. It contributes to the goal of becoming a self-sufficient institution by developing externally sourced research projects. Development of research projects, follow-up of approval and contract processes, and management of projects are carried out within the framework of relevant procedures. 2.1. Project Proposal and Acceptance Process This process involves planning a project, creating its budget, discussing it in the relevant SU internal research councils AEK, ÜAK, FMTK) when necessary, preparing and submitting the offer to the project financing body, preparing the contract, conducting and signing the negotiations, and official approval and acceptance of the project.

Support to be provided when the project application is made (those who get A and B scores); (Those who score A or B are given additional points in their KAF calculations, and those who score A are given additional incentives in their PAF calculations.) Support to be provided after project acceptance/execution phase; (principal investigator expenses included in the ERC budget are paid in addition to the personnel’s salary. 40% of the project overhead amount is allocated to the use of the principal investigator. In exceptional cases, the reduction or increase of this percentage is determined by the decision of the President and the Secretary General (RG). Upon Dean's decision, course load may be reduced. Additional points are given in APDS and KAF calculations. Achievement awards are given to principal investigators who successfully complete the project. After the ERC project is completed, a full scholarship support can be given to the doctoral student for 3 years by evaluating their contribution to the project.
