It aims to ensure an orderly and planned flow of information between units, ensuring that information, announcements, and activities directed to internal and external stakeholders are delivered within the required information and approval mechanisms, and that content complies with the university's institutional identity and the university's established rules. Scope All written, visual, and verbal internal announcements and notifications, made to the university's students, families, alumni, and administrative and academic staff via platforms such as the internal portal (MySU), digital newspaper (gazeteSU), institutional website (sabanciuniv.edu), the sabanciuniv.edu extension websites of all units operating within Sabancı University, institutional information email (SU Info), mobile applications of internal communication channels, and text messages, and in compliance with the institutional identity rules, are considered within the scope of this document. Principle All internal and external communication activities, as well as written and visual materials representing the University, must comply with the fundamental elements and conditions outlined in the Sabancı University Institutional Identity Guide and Communication Guide. Relevant content must be created in accordance with Sabancı University's institutional reputation, philosophy, and general publishing principles. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations SU: Sabancı University MIC: Marketing and Institutional Communications Directorate General Approval: General Approval: All University units receive guidance and support from MIC for all internal and external communication activities reflecting the institutional identity and conducted for internal and external stakeholders. Regulations Rules Sabancı University's internal and external communication activities are carried out under the management of MIC, with the guidance of the unit(s) requesting the work, gathering the necessary information from relevant stakeholders, and obtaining approval from the President's Office and the Secretary General's Office, if deemed necessary by the relevant unit(s), and the MIC or the relevant unit(s). MIC conducts internal and external communication activities within the framework of the annual plan. For all communication activities not included in the plan and arising from daily developments/needs, the necessary information regarding the work must be submitted to MIC via the MIC support request form or email as soon as possible before the requested date (the minimum timeframe for planning in the form is one week). The MIC unit is responsible for ensuring that the content, visuals, and design of internal and external communication activities conform to the corporate identity at every stage of the project. The relevant unit(s) are responsible for verifying the accuracy and appropriateness of all content-related matters. Projects are processed after the approval of the relevant unit and a final check by the MIC. The relevant unit(s) and the MIC jointly decide on the platform on which the internal and external communication activities will be conducted. The process is initiated with the approval of senior management. If a budget is required for the project, the MIC or the relevant unit will make new adjustments within their own budgets and, if necessary, revise and finalize the annual budget plan. Processes are determined based on the scope of work after mutual discussion. All visual and promotional materials used in internal and external communication activities must comply with the rules specified in the Sabancı University Institutional Identity Guide and the Communication Guide. (See Institutional Identity Instruction Letter (IMIC-S510-01). The process for internal and external communication activities involves the relevant unit(s) providing detailed information to the MIC about the activities in question, making preliminary preparations for the requested details (scope, budget, and purchasing if needed), and making the necessary purchases and carrying out the relevant activities. The annual budget for print and digital communication materials may vary depending on the project. All print and digital communication materials during the production process are included in the MIC budget and are covered by the budget allocated for the specific project. Additional needs are evaluated and planned in collaboration with the relevant unit. During the production process, the MIC obtains and processes the approval of the relevant unit and, if necessary, senior management in writing (can be received via email).
