Principle gazeteSU publishes in accordance with Sabancı University's institutional reputation, philosophy, and general publishing principles. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations Regulations Process: Agenda Planning Process Sabancı University's Institutional and Internal Communications Unit monitors the university's weekly/monthly agenda, as well as other leading Turkish and international universities in the competitive set. News items that will make up the agenda are submitted from relevant faculties, centers, forums, administrative and academic units via the MIC Request Form or via email. Incoming agenda items are evaluated within the annual and weekly publication plan. News items are placed on the agenda for email distribution at GazeteSU, in coordination with the digital marketing team, and shared on the university's external website and social media accounts such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc., in line with the agenda plan. A publication time is determined. Content Creation Process Content received from faculties, centers, forums, administrative and academic units, or directly obtained through research from other sources, is translated into the institutional news language as needed, and a draft text is created. For news-specific articles, photographs and/or visuals related to the content are also requested from the relevant person/unit for use within the article. The draft text is submitted to the relevant person, unit, faculty, center, or forum for approval. Publication Process The photo and/or specially designed news image to be shared with the news content is resized to 636x420 by the creative agency or design team. Approved news texts are published on the designated agenda date by selecting the appropriate category from the eight specified categories. The published news is indexed for Google searches by identifying keywords related to the content. If the content allows, one or two-word tags are created to identify similar content in gazeteSU searches. The week's important agenda items are positioned in order of importance and agenda in five different main slider areas on the gazeteSU homepage. News items are positioned in the main slider area, as slides 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, based on their content. News Sharing Published news items are shared on Sabancı University's external website, social media accounts, and the gazeteSU Twitter account, in line with the established agenda plan. Email Delivery Process GazeteSU emails are planned to be sent to the mailing list, which includes Sabancı University members, as one, two, or four news items within the weekly agenda. Emails are scheduled for five weekdays during the academic year and two or three days during holidays and special periods. During official holidays or academic breaks, the necessary delivery dates are arranged with the support of the Information Technologies Department for weekday mailings when gazeteSU will not be sent. Year-End Almanac A video almanac is prepared using selected news items from the news items published during the year, considering the balance of faculties, centers, forums, and units. The prepared video almanac will be presented as a teaser at the end of the year and/or as a long version in the first gazeteSU email of the new year. Advertising Areas If requests from external companies are received and deemed appropriate after internal evaluation, advertising content from external companies may be published in the designated advertising area on the gazeteSU homepage. The advertising fee submitted to the companies will be transferred to the unit budget or scholarship fund. Google Analytics Tracking Readership rates of the news featured on gazeteSU are tracked using the Google Analytics system. A report can be shared with senior management if necessary.
