Regulations Part I: Covers Sabancı University permanent faculty members . 1. IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES 1.1. Annual Salary Increase Sabancı University adopts a compensation policy that can be competitive both locally and internationally. With this policy, on the one hand, it aims to recruit faculty members who are successful in their fields, and on the other hand, it ensures that the salary levels of current faculty members develop in proportion to their performance and achievements throughout their careers at Sabancı University. Cpmpensation of faculty members is managed by pay scales determined for each academic title and discipline. Salary data has a PIR value on the scale. It is essential for sustainable pay management that this value be between the minimum and maximum values on the scale. All salaries outside the scale are subject to the President’s approval. Salary scales are reviewed by Human Resources by making relevant local and international comparisons at the beginning of each academic term and submitted to the President for written approval. When determining the University budget regarding annual salary increases, inflation level, local and international higher education salary market, both the local and international position of the university, strategic goals, and results of the University are taken into consideration. The annual salary increase budget is determined by Human Resources, taking these data into account, and is submitted to the President for written evaluation. The President receives approval from the Board of Trustees for the salary increase budget. The university aims to use the annual salary increase as a practice that rewards high performance and encourages success. After the salary increase budget is approved by the Board of Trustees, Human Resources conducts a salary increase rate distribution study within the budget through the Academic Performance Evaluation System scores, and the annual salary increase percentage is determined within the budget according to the APES results. The performance scores to be determined for each faculty member must be one of the following 6 options: \"Outstanding\", \"Exceed\" (i.e. exceeding expectations), \"Achievement\", \"Development\", \"Probation\" and \"Pending Dismissal\". Outstanding: This score indicates that a faculty member has demonstrated extraordinary performance. The work practices of such faculty members are followed as good practices. Events are organized to enhance the recognition of such faculty members and to appreciate their achievements in- and outside of the university. A faculty member in this group is one of the strongest candidates for benefitting from potential salary arrangements made on top of the regular annual salary increase. Exceed: This score indicates that a faculty member has exceeded the expectations of achievement set by the university. Events are organized to appreciate the achievements of such faculty members. A faculty member in this group is a candidate for benefitting from potential salary arrangements made on top of the regular annual salary increase. Achievement: This score indicates that a faculty member has demonstrated the performance targeted by the university and had a successful year. Development : This score indicates that a faculty member has a performance inferior to that targeted by the university. If such faculty members’ position-in-range is below the minimum, they will receive a salary increase at a rate equal to the university’s budgeted salary increase rate. If it is above the minimum, they will receive a salary increase at a rate lower than the university’s budgeted salary increase rate. If a faculty member is assigned a “Development” score three years in a row, their third score is deemed as “Probation”. Probation: The performance of a faculty member in this group is monitored by the Dean and a written development plan is made. Such faculty members require close monitoring and mentoring. Regardless of their position-in-range, faculty members in this group will receive a salary increase lower than the university’s budgeted salary increase rate. If a faculty member is assigned a “Probation” score in two consecutive evaluations, their second score is deemed as “Pending Dismissal”. Pending Dismissal: The performance of a faculty member in this group is monitored by the Dean and an urgent development plan is made. Such faculty members require very close monitoring and mentoring. Faculty members in this group will not receive any salary increase. The Academic Performance Commission re-evaluates faculty members with a \"Probation\" score within one year at the latest and those with a \"Pending Dismissal\" score within 6 months at the latest and makes a decision accordingly. The University reserves the right to make annual salary increases. The President carries out the process of monitoring, auditing, and reporting remuneration practices on behalf of the Board of Trustees through the Human Resources Director. 1.2. Variable Income All income earned by faculty members other than the base salary guaranteed by the university is called \"variable income\". The total variable income earned by faculty members in each academic year is determined by an algorithm that will gradually reward faculty members based on the project income provided to the university by the relevant faculty member. The rules regarding the \"overhead share\", which has an important place among variable income, are shared in the \"Overhead Guide\" document under the \"Contracted Projects Development and Offer Procedure (PSUATT-A610-01-04)\" and the relevant forms. Exceptions are subject to the President’s approval. 1.3. Confidentiality Salary information of faculty members is confidential information that should not be shared with anyone. 2. REVİEW This instruction letter comes into force on the date of approval and is reviewed under the responsibility of the Human Resources Directorate and updated when necessary. Part II: Covers all administrative employees and project employees at Sabancı University . 1. IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES 1.1. Job Evaluation and Grade Structure 1.1.1. Job Evaluation The HR Directorate takes job evaluation, which is an objective methodology, as the basis for all HR processes of the University, particularly compensation and benefits. The job evaluation evaluates the job, not the jobholder, and it is independent of individual performance. Job evaluation is a systematic process in which a logical and fair ranking of jobs is made by comparing them with other jobs and with a predetermined scale. The following items are taken into account in job evaluation; A comparative and systematic evaluation is made. The job is evaluated, not the person. The person's current title and salary are not taken into consideration. Jobs are evaluated with their current and valid descriptions; planned or possible changes are not taken into account. The contribution of the job to the organization is measured by the main factors of knowledge-skills, problem solving, and responsibility. Following the job evaluation, the grade of a job becomes definite in a numerical way. The job grade not only provides input for HR applications within the University, but is also used for the purpose of benchmarking with external institutions. All the jobs at the University were evaluated by an independent consultancy company and job grades were determined. If deemed necessary, Human Resources carries out job evaluation of the existing jobs and new jobs and receives consultancy support in this regard when necessary. Human Resources is responsible for keeping job values updated within the University. 1.1.2. Grade Structure Grade structure involves the grouping of jobs in an organization into bands considering the results of the job evaluation and the level of value a job can add to the organization. 1.2. Determination of Compensation Policy and Range Sabancı University participates, through the HR Directorate, in salary surveys made by independent research companies every year. HR prepares and sends the data to research companies. Among the companies participating in the research, salary reports of the companies which can accurately reflect the market data, which the University competes with and from which the University wants to attract human resources is obtained. In the light of the information in this report and in line with the University's strategies, the salary scales for all administrative employees at the University is determined or revised. Employees with a permanent employment contract are paid a bonus at the amount equal to one-third of their monthly gross salary. Employees with a fixed-term employment contract are not paid bonuses. Variable income payments for administrative employees and project employees are made with the approval of the President and the Secretary General. 1.3. Annual Salary Increase 1.3.1. Determination of Annual Salary Increase Budget To determine the annual salary increase budget, HR makes an analysis according to CPI data of the previous period, CPI expectations going forward, market practices, and the position for which the University aims in salary management, and submits their proposal to the President and the Secretary General. Final approval for the annual salary increase budget is given by the Board of Trustees. The University reserves the right to make annual salary increases. The President carries out the process of monitoring, auditing, and reporting compensation practices on behalf of the Board of Trustees through the Human Resources Director. 1.3.2. Implementation of Annual Salary Increase 1.3.2.1. Employees with a Permanent Employment Contract The annual salary increase rate of employees is calculated by using a two-factor mathematical model. The two factors are the performance score of employees for the current period, and their salary’s position in the market. The performance system was built in such a way as to enable the university’s staff members to carry out work that supports the achievement of the university’s strategic objectives. The salary increase study is prepared by Human Resources and forwarded to the relevant business leaders. Notification letters regarding salary increases are shared with employees through the system. Salary increases for permanent employees working at Sabancı University are made in January, taking into account the performance level and market increase rates. However, in years when inflation is at a high level, the increase rate determined by taking into account the protection rate of living standards and the increase rates in the market can also be applied in July as an upper limit. Outside of the specified increase periods, the employee's performance and potential are taken into account when making exceptional adjustments due to PIR (position in range). 1.3.2.2. Employees with a Fixed-Term Employment Contract and Project Employees Salary increases for fixed-term employees and project employees working at Sabancı University are made in January, taking into account the performance level and market increase rates. However, in years when inflation is at a high level, the increase rate determined by taking into account the protection rate of living standards and the increase rates in the market can also be applied in July as an upper limit. For project employees, the adequacy of the project budget and contract start times are taken into account. Apart from the specified increase periods, when making exceptional adjustments due to PIR (position in range), the adequacy of the project budget, and the performance and potential of the employee are taken into account. 1.4. Determination of Salary for New Employees The core principle for salaries to be proposed to new employees is that the proposed salaries should be between the minimum and maximum values of the salary range for the grade of the role, which is determined in line with job evaluation principles. Salaries to be proposed to new administrative staff members are studied by HR and the Business Leader to whom the position reports, is informed. Salaries to be proposed to new project staff members are studied by HR. The appropriateness of the salary to be proposed is checked within the scope of the Research Projects Process Management Instruction Letter (ISUATT-A610-01) and the Project Manager is informed. In the case that a request is made to study a salary proposal to go above the maximum value in range, approval of the President and the Secretary General must be obtained. 1.5. Promotion, Appointment-Assignment, Organizational Changes, Rotation, Change of Status of Employment Contract, Participation in Projects 1.5.1. Promotion Following the evaluaiton carried out by Human Resources, a salary study is prepared for the employees whose grade is increased and submitted for the approval of the President and the Secretary General. After the relevant approvals are received, the relevant Business Leader is informed by Human Resources. A promotion letter is sent to the employee through the system. Promotions can be made within the relevant year, except the period when the annual salary increase takes place. General rules applicable to promotions are as follows: Promotional salary increase is determined according to employees' PIR in their new job grade. New employees are supposed to have worked in their current position for at least 1 performance period to be eligible for promotion. 1.5.2. Assignment Assignments take place according to organizational needs. Appointments to managerial positions can take place at any time of the year. Request for appointment is forwarded by the related business leader to the HR Directorate, and the request is implemented following approval from the President and the Secretary General. The salary of an employee, who has been assigned to a new role by changing his/her job grade is determined by taking into account the scale of his new position. In principle, it is recommended to review an employee’s salary by taking into account the variables belonging to his new position, if he/she has been assigned to a new role without changing his/her grade. 1.5.3. Organizational Changes Organizational changes can be made due to the needs of a unit, changes in the market, or organizational improvements. Any centralization, restructuring, or changes to the organizational chart are made upon the approval of the business leader of the related unit, the HR Department, the President, and the Secretary General. The HR Department is responsible for using all necessary HR tools to implement decisions about organizational changes and is responsible for coordinating the whole process. Promotions and assignments that come with organizational changes take place at the date when the change becomes effective. 1.5.4. Rotation Rotation involves employees’ acquiring new functions within their current unit or in different units of the organization, and change of their job description in the light of these new functions. Rotations may take place upon re-evaluation of the functions of units, centralization, HR evaluations and guidance, the guidance of a unit manager, or upon request of an employee. Job re-evaluation is made for an employee whose job description changes upon rotation. The new job grade of an employee is determined upon the evaluation of their job description in their new role based on the know-how, problem solving, and accountability dimensions. If an employee moves to a role with higher job grade, evaluation is made as to promotion of the employee based on the success during the 1 year of performance following the rotation. If an employee moves to a role with a lower job grade, the reason for the downgrade is treated on an individual basis, and it is HR’s responsibility to evaluate and decide accordingly. The rotation process is carried out under the coordination of Human Resources, who have to be consulted at every step of the process. 1.5.5. Change of Status of Employment Contract 1.5.5.1. Contract Change from Fixed to Permanent Term In exceptional cases, the University can make employees with a fixed-term contract move to a permanent contract according to need. A request for such a move is forwarded by the related business leader to the HR Directorate, and is implemented following approval from the President and the Secretary General. For the approval process, the request for the contract change must be justified with a written evaluation report. In the process of contract change , employees pass an interview process where their competencies are evaluated. Employees must be successful in this assessment process. Employees move to a permanent contract with their existing rights maintained. Additional evaluations may be made considering variables in their new role. 1.5.6. Participation of Administrative Staff in Projects It is essential that SU administrative staff members should not be made to work in research projects in return for additional pay or similar benefits/rewards. It is essential that administrative staff members taking part in research projects should do so in the framework of their normal job description. Variable income payments for administrative employees and project employees are made with the approval of the President and the Secretary General. 1.6.
