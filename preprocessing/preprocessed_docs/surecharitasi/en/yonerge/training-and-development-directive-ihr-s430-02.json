Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations University: Sabancı University Regulations Application: 1. Determining Training Needs: Unit managers observe and coach their employees throughout the year to determine their development areas and the competencies they will need in the future. They specify these areas in the Year-End Performance Development Form. When determining the topics to be included in the Annual HR Training Plan, the following aspects are taken into account: Training needs specified in the Performance Development Forms (FHR-S46002-01), Training needs requests received verbally or in writing from unit managers throughout the year, “Areas of development needed” specified by employees in their Training Evaluation Forms, Competencies, knowledge, and skills that will be at the forefront to achieve the University’s annual and medium-term goals, Employees’ and Managers’ Common Competencies Competencies that employees may need due to remote work The HR Training budget cannot be used for unit-specific technical knowledge and skill needs. 2. Preparation of the Training Plan: After determining the priority training needs for that year, a plan is prepared and submitted to the Secretary General for approval along with the cost calculation. While preparing the plan, feedback received from managers regarding the effectiveness of the training programs organized in previous years is taken into consideration. 3. Selection of Trainers: After the budget and plan are approved, interviews are held with training companies and consultants providing training on the determined subjects and offers are received. The most suitable company and trainer are selected to provide the training. Training Evaluation Forms regarding companies that provided training in previous years are utilized and references are obtained from other institutions. 4. Creation of the Training Calendar: A training calendar is created for the year by determining the dates of the training sessions with the training companies that are decided to work with. 5. Receiving Participant Requests: The training calendar is communicated to unit managers who are then asked to list employees from their units who need to develop their competence in the training subject due to their job requirements and report it to HR. 6. Determination of Participants: HR evaluates the requests from all units by considering the priorities and needs and determines the participants. 7. Training Participation Information: After the participants are determined for each training, the managers of the relevant unit are notified. The manager is expected to inform the employees from their unit who will participate about their participation and provide information about how the training they will attend will benefit the employee and what is expected from them later on. HR sends an invitation e-mail to the participants before the training date, informing them about the content, location, and time of the training. If the participant cannot attend the training, they notify HR of this situation at least one week before the training. Another employee who has been suggested to attend the training is provided to attend in lieu of the employee who cannot attend. 8. Organization of Training: The training location is determined by the HR Officer, the training is prepared in accordance with the trainer's request, and all other logistic preparations such as training materials and refreshments are made. 9. Evaluation and Reporting of Training: After the training is completed, participants are asked to fill out a Training Evaluation Form to evaluate the content of the training and the trainer. These forms are then reviewed by HR and a training evaluation report is created. The feedback received with this form is taken into account when planning subsequent trainings. 10. Measuring the Effectiveness of Training: The effectiveness of technical training programs is measured with tests applied before or after the training. In order to measure the effectiveness of non-technical training programs, managers are asked at the end of the year whether any training programs were found ineffective. During the performance development process, managers observe employees regarding the development of competencies in the areas they receive training and provide HR with their general feedback on the effectiveness of the training programs before the training plan is made. 11. Keeping Training Participation Records: After the training is completed, information about the training and the individuals who attended the training is entered into the system and a report can be obtained. If the employee is provided with a unit budget with the recommendation of their manager, other than the training programs organized by HR, the manager reports the training programs attended by the employee (including the name of the training, the company providing the training, and the duration of the training) to HR to be entered into the system. This information is also included in the training reports. 12. Conditions for Participation in Training: Care should be taken to ensure that the training to be offered to the employee is on a subject that will develop the competencies and skills the employee needs to carry out their current functions. New employees are included in the training plan after their probation period is over. Related Procedures Related Forms Eğitim Değerlendirme Formu (FHR-S43002-01) Related Form Links"
