Scope This instruction letter covers permanent administrative staff members. Principle Sabancı University attaches importance to the development of its employees in line with their career goals and the strengthening of their competencies. It carries out the talent management process with a participatory, objective, and systematic approach that is compatible with the strategic objectives of the university. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations University: Sabancı University Manager: The person who evaluates the potential of the permanent administrative staff members for higher roles and responsibilities. This person can be the President, Secretary General, Vice- President, Dean, Director or Manager. Potential: The employee's willingness to take on more responsibility for higher roles and responsibilities, gain experience, and improve themselves by learning from these experiences. Critical Position: These are tasks and roles that play a decisive role in achieving the strategic objectives of the university and are critical for the sustainability of processes. Leadership Potential and Learning Agility Assessment Inventory: This is an assessment inventory that is conducted to determine potential candidates who can take over critical positions in the organization and provides information about the leadership potential of the participants. Talent Codes: These are the codes used to determine suitable candidates when creating succession plans. Talent codes are determined by considering the results of the inventory that is applied and the level of preparation for leadership potential. High Potential: Individuals who currently have the leadership and/or learning agility potential to undertake critical positions, the capacity for development, and the willingness to take on more responsibility. They can back up the General Secretary, Director, and Manager positions. Promotable: Individuals who need time and development to be able to undertake critical positions and fully demonstrate their leadership and/or learning agility potential. They can back up the General Secretary, Director, and Manager positions. Replacement: Individuals who have the leadership and/or learning agility potential required for their current positions, but do not have sufficient potential to back up critical positions. They can back up positions requiring expertise greater than their current roles in their areas of expertise, but they cannot back up the General Secretary, Director, and Manager positions. Professional: Individuals who stand out from other employees with their subject knowledge, technical knowledge, and/or experience. They have career development potential in their area of ​​expertise due to their long years of field experience. They are expected not to be in the back up of critical positions. Young Potential: Individuals who are evaluated as “High Potential” and are thought to have the potential to back up Director positions in the long term. These individuals are expected to have less than 5 years of total work experience and an English level of C1 or equivalent. Incompatible: Individuals who cannot demonstrate the leadership and/or learning agility potential required by their current position. Action (urgent development plan, rotation, etc.) must be taken for these individuals.

A1 Can express simple expressions about personal details and concrete needs at a very basic level. Can use some basic language structures in single-clause sentences by omitting or reducing some elements. Regulations TALENT MANAGEMENT PROCESS The Talent Management process consists of the following stages: 1. Determining English Skills: The prerequisite for being included in the talent management process is to have English language skills at the specified level. Employees who do not have sufficient English language skills cannot be included in the inventory application phase. The English proficiency exam for the talent management process is conducted by the School of Languages. Employees who already have a valid English exam result conducted by the School of Languages ​​for Erasmus Employee Mobility can choose not to take the exam and use the relevant result in the process if they wish. Candidates who are included in the scope of backup of Director and above roles must have a minimum B2 or equivalent level of English knowledge in order to proceed to the inventory phase, and candidates who are included in the scope of backup of Manager roles must have a minimum B1 or equivalent level of English knowledge. The exam conducted by the School of Languages ​​within the scope of talent management is valid for 2 years. However, employees can retake the talent management English proficiency exam in the new term before this period expires if they request. The most recent exam result is always taken into account in the talent management process. 2. Inventory Application: Candidates with sufficient English knowledge can proceed to the inventory stage. For candidates in leadership and above positions, the Leadership Potential Assessment Inventory is applied, and for candidates in specialist roles, the Learning Agility Assessment Inventory is applied. After the inventory application, relevant reports are shared with employees and their managers. 3. Performance Assessment Result In order for employees to be evaluated in the high potential code, their performance level must be at least 130 within the range of 0-200. In order to be evaluated in the codes of promotable, replacement, professional, and young potential, the performance level is expected to be at least 100. 4. Talent Management Meetings & Determination of Backup Candidates: Talent management meetings are held with the units in which inventory results and talent codes are evaluated. The unit manager may suggest that the employee's talent code be changed upwards or downwards by no more than 1 level. Concrete justifications are requested for the suggestion and the person's inventory results are evaluated by Human Resources. The final decision on the suggestion is made with the approval of the President and Secretary General. In the relevant meetings, backup plans are created by reviewing the critical roles determined in the unit. Candidates with a skill code of \"High Potential\" and \"Promotable\" can be included in the short- (0-1 year) and medium-term (1-3 year) backup plan. No conditions are sought for employees to be included in the Emergency backup plan. There is no need for an emergency backup for roles whose short-term (0-1 year) backup plan is full. 5. President and Secretary General Approval: Talent codes and backup plans are finalized after the approval of the President and Secretary General for approval. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PROCESS Employees are responsible for planning and implementing the development actions required to ensure their own development in line with their career goals. Managers provide the necessary resources and development tools as much as the university's means permit, by supporting employees in determining and implementing development actions. Career development tools include rotation, job enrichment, working in different functions, feedback from peers, taking on roles in projects, taking on higher-level responsibilities, coaching or mentoring, and training programs. Apart from these tools, employees determine their own development actions and lead their own career development by implementing them. The criteria to be taken into consideration for our employees who are proposed by their managers to progress in the development process and take on wider responsibilities and be promoted are given in the table below. In promotion decisions, another critical prerequisite is not only the desired level of competence and performance of the employee, but also the growth and enrichment of the work done. In the creation of new and additional responsibilities and enriched positions, it is essential that the organizational structure of the relevant unit maintains its lean structure that supports the strategic objectives of the university. Promotion to Leader and Above Positions Promotion to Senior Specialist Positions Minimum B2 and equivalent English skills Talent code must be high potential or promotable Taking on additional responsibilities that will require a grade increase and growth of the business Having a team that is/will be subordinate to them Performance evaluation result must be minimum 130 Minimum B1 and equivalent English skills Skill code must be high potential, promotable, or replacement Taking on additional responsibilities that will require a grade increase and growth of the business Having the technical knowledge and competence to guide the processes they carry out without consulting their managers Performance evaluation result must be minimum 130 Related Procedures Related Forms Related Form Links"
