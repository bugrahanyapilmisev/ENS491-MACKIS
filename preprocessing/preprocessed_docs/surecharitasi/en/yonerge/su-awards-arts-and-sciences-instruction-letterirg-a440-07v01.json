Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations FASS: Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences FENS: Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences SBS: Sabancı Business School SU: Sabancı University URC: University Research Council VP-R: Vice President for Research and Development Regulations A. Award Categories Sabancı University Awards in Arts and Sciences are given in the following categories: Outstanding Scholar Award Lightning Scholar Award Societal Impact Award 2. The Outstanding Scholar Award is given to individuals who have demonstrated distinguished accomplishments in the fields of science and arts, through groundbreaking work that has significantly contributed to the advancement of their discipline. Activities that strengthen the research environment of SU are also considered as supporting elements within the scope of this award category. 3. The Lightning Scholar Award is given to individuals who have carried out high-impact and groundbreaking research or artistic activity in their field in the early stages of their career (such as publishing an article in one of the best journals in their field, being awarded a prestigious international project support). 4. Within the scope of the Societal Impact Award, social contribution created by studies carried out in the fields of science and art is taken into consideration. It is given to individuals who have delivered a research output/activity that has had a direct impact on society or has the potential to do so. Awareness-raising activities regarding the societal impact of research carried out at the university are also considered as supporting elements within the scope of this award category. B. Eligibility Criteria Candidates must have been working as a full-time faculty member at Sabancı University for at least 3 years. Individuals can apply for the award categories within the scope of the Sabancı University Awards in Arts and Sciences themselves or be nominated by a Sabancı University member who is a full-time academic staff. An individual may receive an award in a given category only once. Individuals who have received an award in one of the SU Awards in Arts and Sciences categories or the Sakıp Sabancı Research Award in the last 2 years are not eligible. However, an individual who receives the “Lightning Scholar Award” is eligible for the “Outstanding Scholar Award” or “Societal Impact Award” the following year. To be eligible to apply/be nominated for the Lightning Scholar Award category, no more than 7 years must have passed since the person received their PhD. This period may be extended by 2 years due to career interruptions such as sick leave or maternity leave. C. Application/Nomination Process The starting date of the application/nomination process for the awards is determined by the URC each year. An announcement is made to the entire University regarding the start of the application/nomination process. The announcement also includes the necessary instructions for application/nomination. Applications and nomination proposals are collected via SUForm. The following information and documents are required regarding the applicant/nominated faculty member: Detailed CV of the candidate Self-nomination letter not exceeding 3 pages, referring to the award criteria and stating the evidence Supporting evidence documents related to the evidence specified in the self-nomination letter Names of the proposed external evaluators who may be consulted during the evaluation process D. Evaluation Panel The evaluation panel comprises members of SU. Evaluation panel, consisting of one chair and minimum five - maximum seven members, includes three members appointed by the Faculty Boards (one member from each faculty, FENS, FASS, and SBS), and the remaining members selected by the URC. VP-R chairs the panel, but does not have voting rights. Evaluation panel members cannot nominate candidates. E. Evaluation Process Only research conducted at Sabancı University, along with its associated outputs, will be taken into consideration during the evaluation process. In the event of a high number of applications, the evaluation panel will conduct a preliminary evaluation according to the evaluation criteria and create shortlists based on field and category. In order for the evaluation panel to make an objective and independent evaluation, in addition to the documents submitted during the application process, the opinions of at least 3 internationally recognized field experts are taken into account for the candidates on the shortlist. The external evaluator opinions are gathered through a structured, standardized format. The external evaluators who will be consulted are determined by the evaluation panel, taking into account the names suggested by the candidate and the Dean of the Faculty to which the candidate is affiliated. The relevant external evaluators are given an honorarium to thank them for their contributions to the process. During the evaluation process, no distinction is made between candidates who were nominated and those who applied on their own. Evaluations are carried out using a standardized form specific to each award category. Only one individual is planned to be awarded per category. However, the number may be increased if there are equally qualified candidates in terms of evaluation criteria. In addition, if there are not enough applications in any category or if no one can be found among the candidates who meet the criteria for the relevant category, the relevant award may not be given that year. F. Evaluation Criteria The following criteria are taken into consideration when evaluating the Outstanding Scholar Award: Continuity and prevalence of the research activities conducted in their area of expertise Having strong publication performance (prominence of field-recognized indices, having international collaboration, being the lead author/responsible author (first or last author) according to the field, etc.) Prestige of the journals in which the selected publications are published (having publications published in prestigious journals (a journal with a high impact factor, Q1/Top 10%/Top 5% according to the field), etc.) Project performance (having high project budgets, having projects with significant impact, taking part in international and/or collaborative projects, prestige and distinctiveness of the projects, prestige of the fund supporting the research, etc.) High-quality and impactful research outputs specific to the field, such as policy documents/reports, patents, utility models, conference/symposium presentations, artistic production, design, exhibitions, and other related outputs that make a significant impact within the field Having received national/international awards and the prestige associated with them Originality and rigorousness of the research conducted by the researcher Being invited as an academy member/chair by various scientific committees, events attended as a keynote/invited speaker, leadership roles in scientific organizations Contribution to the education, teaching, and research infrastructure of SU in their field (establishing an educational program/center/laboratory, making effective contributions to centers/laboratories, having innovative course designs in the field, educating graduate students, etc.) Developing international strategic collaborations that significantly increase the research capacity of the university in the relevant field (such as establishing an international joint doctoral program) Activities that enhance the recognition and prestige of the university (such as serving as the scientific board or organizing committee chair of a leading international conference) Leading research activities that reinforce Sabancı University's position in focused research areas Undertaking editorial duties in leading journals in the relevant scientific field 2.
