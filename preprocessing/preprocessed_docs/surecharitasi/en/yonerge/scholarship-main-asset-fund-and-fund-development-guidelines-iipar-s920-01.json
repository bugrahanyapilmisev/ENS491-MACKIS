  "text": "Instruction No IIPAR-S920-01 Effective Date 09-11-2009 Update Date Related Unit / Owner IPAR / Kurumsal İşbirlikleri ve Mezunlarla İlişkiler Approved by BT / Board of Trustees Aim This instruction letter establishes the principles for cash and in-kind support and donations from domestic and international sources during the development of the Main Scholarship Fund, established to provide financial support to successful undergraduate and graduate students in need of financial support studying at Sabancı University, and the development of new funds. Scope This instruction letter covers the fundraising activities that SU must undertake to meet specific development needs from domestic and international sources, targeting both \"natural persons\" (SU alumni and students, SU friends, families of SU students and alumni, SU employees, and other individuals) and \"legal entities\" (institutions, foundations, organizations, etc.). Fundraising activities conducted within the framework of research projects and grant and/or sponsorship agreements of university units are not covered by this instruction letter. Principle To ensure broad public support and support for Sabancı University's mission and goals, it is essential that fundraising activities be conducted in accordance with the University's philosophy, values, and strategic objectives. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations SU: Sabancı University IPAR: Institutional Partnerships and Alumni Relations Directorate FA: SU Financial Affairs Directorate BT: SU Board of Trustees SUMED: SU Alumni Association LAW: Law Department SR: Student Resources Directorate MIC: Marketing and Institutional Communications Directorate FR: (Fundraising) This refers to the process of raising all non-governmental cash and in-kind resources for Sabancı University to meet SU's institutional needs. Donation: Cash or in-kind resources transferred to SU's most appropriate fund as part of the fundraising activities of the IPAR unit and BT, or as a result of the guidance of relevant SU employees, SU alumni, SU students, and friends. Donor: An individual, institution, foundation, or other organization that donates to support SU's educational and research mission or its infrastructure needs. Potential Donors: Individuals and institutions with the desire and capacity to donate to SU. Scholarship Fund Donations: These are cash and in-kind donations transferred to the SU Fund to generate revenue for the university. Unconditional donations: These are donations made by the donor without any conditions or restrictions on how SU will use the resources and/or their generated income. Conditional donations: These are donations based on the donor's preferences and provided to SU under certain conditions and restrictions. (For example, donations made to students in a specific field of study for the advancement of a specific academic field, etc.) Regulations 1. Basic Conditions/Principles: 1.1. Determination of Fundraising Goals and Priorities: Because SU is a non-profit educational institution by law and serves the public good, it may request institutional support from designated target groups. Fundraising goals and target groups are determined by the BT in accordance with the university's strategic plan and in a way that serves the university's priorities, and are reviewed at the end of each year. 1.2. Fundraising Critical Success Factors: SU's success in fundraising is based on its institutional structure and ability to address this issue in a disciplined and coordinated manner. To ensure that the university is perceived by external stakeholders as a coherent, holistic institution, and in harmony with all its units in terms of its resource development processes: • Donations, funds, etc., managed by all faculties and units within the university. Fundraising activities must be consistent and coordinated with the fundraising objectives. • Ensuring the high quality of all fundraising activities at the university. • Properly recording and honoring donors. • Creating and updating a database of potential donors. • Creating and implementing joint internal and external communication strategies. • Supporting all donation programs, campaigns, and fundraising calls by all faculties and units within the university. When necessary, managing donation programs, campaigns, and fundraising calls with mixed working groups from within and outside the university. 1.3. Acceptance of Donations to SU: SU reserves the right to reject donations that are inconsistent with its philosophy, mission, and goals, or that it deems objectionable based on the various criteria listed below. The final decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of a donation is made by the IPAR Director and the Secretary General; however, if necessary, the matter may be brought to the BT agenda. All donations proposed to SU, and all individuals and institutions wishing to donate, are evaluated primarily based on the following criteria: • The compatibility of the donation and the donor with SU's philosophy, values, mission, goals, and priorities • The donor's reputation, both within SU and in society in general • The donor's non-engagement in activities that are detrimental to the public good • Whether there would be any problems with the donation or the donor's name being associated with SU • Whether the donor's name has been associated with reactionary activities, activities that undermine the unity and integrity of the state, arms and drug trafficking, human trafficking, fraud, corruption, etc. • The donor's intended donation, whether in kind or in cash, does not have any money laundering purposes. Donations are evaluated by the FR Leader and the IPAR Director, and if they do not pose a problem, they are directed to the appropriate fund of SU. If deemed necessary, IPAR, in consultation with the relevant SU units, conducts the necessary research on the prospective donor individual or institution. The donation proposal and the results of the research are submitted to the Secretary General by the IPAR Director. In cases where the Secretary General and/or the SU legal counsel deem it necessary (e.g., donations requiring SU to assume various obligations, conflicts of interest between SU and the donor, etc.), it is recommended that competent legal advisors and financial experts be consulted. 2. Applicable Donation Methods for SU: Applicable donation methods for SU can be listed as follows: • Cash • Immovable assets (buildings, apartments, land, etc.) • Movable assets (stocks, other receivables) • Other assets (vehicles, works of art, etc.) • Life insurance/pension • Inheritance and similar planned donation commitments • Non-cash donations IPAR conducts a due diligence assessment with the FA unit for each proposed donation type, considering its compatibility with the SU mission and institutional priorities. Conditions such as the net value of movable, immovable, etc. assets, and the costs that may be incurred in transferring these donations to SU are reviewed within this framework. SU reserves the right to accept or reject these donations, as stated in Article 1.3. All cash donations to SU can be made via credit card payments, regular or one-time bank transfers, and EFTs, the information about which is available on the SU Donation Website. 3. Fundraising Areas: This guideline covers SU's necessary fundraising activities for the following areas: • Undergraduate and graduate education and need-based scholarships • Campus infrastructure and development needs • Projects determined by the BT or the IPAR Directorate Fundraising activities conducted within the scope of research projects and grant and/or sponsorship agreements of university units are not within the scope of this document. Individual and institutional donation requests that SU will communicate to its stakeholders or direct to SU as part of fundraising activities can be made in the following categories. 3.1. Donations for Undergraduate and Graduate Scholarships At SU, the scholarship types and amounts for each academic year are recommended by the Scholarship Committee and determined by the BT. Scholarship donations, which constitute a crucial cornerstone, are directed to meet the tuition expenses and basic needs of students in need, such as housing, food, transportation, and books. Full scholarships, half scholarships, and many other scholarship formulas change according to these annual decisions and are announced annually through SU-SUMED's internal and external communication channels. The IPAR unit provides the necessary preliminary information and guidance, taking into account the donor's financial resources, inclinations, and proximity to SU, and serves as a tool in determining the donor's preference. For particularly large donations, donations for undergraduate and graduate scholarships can be unconditional or conditional. 3.1.1. Unconditional Scholarships SU's preferred approach to developing the Scholarship Fund is to receive unconditional donations. This will allow SU to be more flexible in addressing its scholarship needs and priorities. Unless there are any conditions, donations for scholarships will be collected within the SU Main Scholarship Fund. Contributions from fundraising activities such as working groups for specific campaigns, as well as from regular annual fundraising campaigns, will feed the Main Scholarship Fund, unless other institutional priorities are identified. 3.1.2. Conditional Scholarships Donors may also make conditional scholarship donations to meet the scholarship needs of undergraduate or graduate students who are starting or continuing their studies at SU. Conditional scholarship donations can be merit-based, or they can focus on a specific field of study that the donor is interested in, or other criteria they wish to support (e.g., gender, or city/country of birth). Decisions regarding all conditional scholarship donations are made by the IPAR Director, the SR Director, and the Secretary General. However, if necessary, the matter may be brought to the BT agenda. 3.1.3. Establishing a Scholarship Fund by Naming An individual or legal entity may wish to establish a Scholarship Fund at SU, which they will name. The prerequisite for this is a written commitment to cover the annual tuition scholarship determined by the BT for at least one undergraduate or graduate student during their regular study period at SU. Each application submitted by a natural or legal person wishing to establish a scholarship fund by giving a name is first evaluated by the IPAR, as specified in Article 1.3 of this document. The final decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of all such applications is made by the BT. The donor may choose to remain anonymous or establish this fund in their own name or in honor of someone else. 3.2. Donations to Chairs Fundraising activities also include existing or newly established chairs at SU. In both cases, potential donors are identified based on SU's academic priorities and needs, and the process of establishing a relationship with SU is initiated. The management of ongoing relationships is undertaken by the fundraising officer and relevant academic unit officials. The payment plan for the establishment of a chair at SU or the financial structuring of the Main Scholarship Fund is determined in coordination by the BT, Human Resources, and the relevant Faculty Dean or the responsible faculty member(s) delegated by the Dean. For the requirements for establishing a chair at SU, see: For example: Erdal İnönü Chair Instruction Letter (IHR-S420-03) Each application submitted by individuals or legal entities seeking the establishment of a chair at SU, motivated by their interest and passion for specific academic fields, is first evaluated by the IPAR, as specified in Article 1.3 of this document. The final decision regarding the acceptance or rejection of all such applications is made by the BT. 3.3. Donations for Campus Infrastructure and Development Needs To meet SU's infrastructural needs, campaigns are conducted for relevant infrastructure projects. These may include the renovation and restoration of buildings, as well as the construction of new academic/administrative and/or student living spaces (pool, dormitories, recreation center, etc.). The final decision on the acceptance or rejection of all applications of this nature is made by the BT. 3.3.1. Naming Physical Spaces on the SU Campus Alumni, as well as individuals and legal entities, may donate their names to physical spaces within the university's campus, such as laboratories, classrooms, halls, seats in the Performance Center, trees in the campus green, etc., as deemed appropriate. Applications in this direction are primarily evaluated by the IPAR as specified in Article 1.3 of this document. The BT makes the final decision on the acceptance or rejection of all applications of this nature. 4. SU Fundraising Methods: 4.1. Fundraising Campaigns consist of donations aimed at ensuring a continuous inflow of resources to SU. Their target audiences are SU Alumni, SU Staff, and Friends (individuals and institutions). 4.2. Rental of SU Venues Buildings, classrooms, halls, amphitheater, meeting rooms, gyms, and similar indoor/outdoor spaces on the SU campuses (Tuzla, Altunizade, and Karaköy) are rented to third parties on a short-term basis under conditions that do not interfere with university life. Revenues from venue rentals are booked upon collection. If the aforementioned SU-owned spaces serve any purpose benefiting SU students and staff, they may be used free of charge, subject to the evaluation and approval of the university administration. Relevant decisions are made by the IPAR Director and/or Secretary General. 4.3. International Donations SU has established a fund called the \"Friends of Sabancı University Fund\" under the umbrella of the Turkish Philanthropic Fund, headquartered in New York. Thanks to this partnership, US citizens or individuals living and working in the US can donate to the SU through this fund, taking advantage of the US tax system incentives. Similar funds can also be established in other countries, facilitating donations to the SU. Establishing such funds requires the execution of the necessary agreements in accordance with the relevant country's regulations and obtaining approval from the Legal Department. 4.4 Donations Made by SU Employees Employees who wish to support the fund can request a deduction from a percentage of their salary or a donation of a specific amount. All employees wishing to donate to the fund can contribute by completing the \"Scholarship Fund Contribution Form\" on SUFORM. All approvals are forwarded to the Human Resources Payroll Department. 5. Donor Rights An individual or institution making a donation to SU must first receive a Donation Receipt, which is documentation that SU has received the donation, as soon as possible. The donor must be informed that their name may remain anonymous if they wish, and must be assured that their personal information will not be used for other purposes. For \"Naming Fund\" donations to SU, a contract is signed between SU and the donor. This agreement is expected to include the following: Whether the donation is conditional or unconditional For what purposes the donation will be used, and the areas where it can be used as an alternative When the donation will be fully transferred When the donation can first be used and the responsibilities related to its use The validity of a donation commitment depends on its being written. A donation commitment of real estate or a real right on real estate is only valid if it is made by official deed (officially in the presence of the land registry official). While it was stated above that a donation agreement will only be made for \"Creating a Fund by Naming\" donations, a donation agreement may also be required for a commitment to donate a real estate-related right. 6. Donor Appreciation and Acknowledgement 6.1. Letters of appreciation are prepared for the donor institutions and individuals, signed by the relevant authorities (Secretary General, President), and sent to the donor in digital or hard copy. 6.1.2 Donors who make a one-time donation to the Scholarship Fund covering the annual tuition scholarship determined by the BT for undergraduate students, are presented with a \"Donor Plaque.\" 7. Fund Financial Management and Communication Processes: 7.1 The Fund's financial management is the responsibility of the Finance Directorate. 7.2. The MIC Directorate supports IPAR in communication processes such as developing internal and external communication strategies for fundraising activities, communicating them to relevant stakeholders, implementing campaigns, and preparing communication materials.
