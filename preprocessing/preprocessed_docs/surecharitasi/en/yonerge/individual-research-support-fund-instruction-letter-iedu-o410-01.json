Scope This instruction letter covers the principles of the Individual Research Support Fund and its utilization. Principle EDU upholds the value that our University places on research by creating a fund to financially support research in order to motivate SU instructors with whom it co-creates and develops programs that create value for the business world. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations IRSF: Individual Research Support Fund IRF: Individual Research Fund EDU: Executive Development Unit Directorate HR: Human Resources Directorate FA: Financial Affairs Directorate Regulations 1. IRSF is a fund given to full-time faculty members/staff and designated visiting faculty members and post-doctoral researchers working at Sabancı University to support their research in return for the training they deliver at EDU during the academic year. 2. The IRSF amount realized during the current academic year is added to the IRF account to be used in the next academic year. 3. IRSF amount is calculated as a certain percentage of SU instructor fees determined by HR at the beginning of each academic year. In programs where a budget can be created for 2020-21, 15% of the instructor's gross wage is paid to the instructor as IRSF in return for the training provided by the instructor. As an exception, this rate is 10% in open education programs with 12 or less participants. 4. IRSF rate revision is determined by RG in line with the approval of the Presidency Council. IRSF rate is notified to the relevant units by the EDU Directorate. 5. Calculation of the IRSF entitlements and their submission to the relevant units is carried out by the EDU Directorate. 6.
