Scope This instruction letter covers the Personal Research Fund and its usage principles. Principle Sabancı University must maintain its status as a leading university with the value it places on research. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations FA: Financial Affairs Directorate, FASS: Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, FDD: Foundations Development Directorate, FENS: Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, HR: Human Resources Directorate, PRF: Personal Research Fund, RPD: Research Process Planning and Policy Development Office, SBS: Sabancı Business School, SU: Sabancı University, SUATT: Research, Development and Technology Transfer Office, TÜMER: Integrated Manufacturing Technologies Research and Application Center, VP-R: Vice President for Research and Development. Regulations PRF is a fund given to researchers working in certain SU units (FENS, FASS, SBS, TÜMER, FDP) according to their research and artistic performance. PRF support, which can be used by full-time faculty members, researchers, some faculty members determined by unit managers and post-doctoral researchers working in Sabancı University units, is given for a period of one academic year. In order to determine the people who can benefit from PRF support, the academic staff list prepared by HR is shared with the relevant unit managers by RPD. The list revised by the unit managers is approved by VP-R. In the PRF process, the research and artistic performance data available as of August 31 of the relevant year is taken into account. The schedule of the PRF process is followed by RPD by informing VP-R with the aim of defining the PRF amounts in the system as soon as possible. Each year, while FA prepares the budget for the following year, the PRF budget for the next academic year is determined by the coordination of VP-R, FA and RPD, taking into account the number of PRF beneficiaries. After the determination of overall SU PRF budget, unit-based PRF budgets are determined by the RPD under the guidance of VP-R. The entire coordination of the PRF process is carried out by RPD. Unit managers distribute the annual PRF budget allocated to their units to PRF users, taking into account their research and artistic performances in line with the unit PRF evaluation criteria. The individual PRF amounts determined by the unit managers are submitted to the approval of VP-R and the President by RPD, together with the document containing the units' PRF evaluation criteria. The evaluations regarding the PRF usage of PRF users who are newly enrolled in SU and PRF users whose contracts will end within that year (such as inclusion in the scope of PRF, calculation based on the months to be worked) are also made by the relevant unit managers. After the PRF amounts are approved by the President, RPD shares them with the FA ensuring that the PRF user units are also informed. The use of PRF is carried out in accordance with the principles outlined in the PRF Usage Principles document, which is annexed to this instruction letter. The monitoring of PRF expenditures is carried out by FA.
