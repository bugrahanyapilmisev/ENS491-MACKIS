A total of approximately 600,000 m2 of forested land is also allocated to SU on the east and west sides of the campus. This system is implemented in accordance with all legal requirements and environmental regulations that promote environmental protection. The Environmental Policy is shared on MySU and the SU website. The policy is discussed annually at the Environmental Management System (EMS) meetings and amended as needed. SU's strategies for combating climate change, circular economy, and net zero transition are included within the EMS. SU established the EMS in 2018, continues to implement it, and ensures its continuous improvement. Within the EMS, the company considers the expectations and needs of relevant parties within the organization, their internal and external contexts, and reviews these issues annually at the EMS meetings. New developments, modified activities, and all new projects that may impact the EMS are monitored. The OHS and Environmental Management Representative reviews the changes and implements or ensures that necessary changes are made to the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System and environmental programs, in accordance with their authority and responsibilities within the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System. Changes to the ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System are discussed at management review meetings. The SU EMS Organization is available on the MySU website ( https://cevre.sabanciuniv.edu/tr# ). All stakeholders can submit any identified environmental problems, nonconformities, improvement suggestions, or positive feedback verbally or in writing to cevre@sabanciuniv.edu , to Environmental Unit Representatives, the Environmental Consultant, the Sustainability Manager, or to the call center at 9988. Received reports are reviewed by the OHS and Environmental Management Representative, forwarded to the relevant units, and action is taken.

Communication processes during emergencies, disasters, and accidents are conducted in accordance with the Emergency Procedure (PPOP-S210-01-02). 1. Environmental Impact Assessment This involves assessing the environmental impacts of all activities carried out within the SU, determining their environmental impacts, identifying the environmental impacts related to the identified environmental impacts, exploring ways to reduce environmental impacts, and establishing methods and implementation rules to minimize environmental impact. The environmental impact assessment is determined as a result of meetings held under the coordination of the OHS and Environmental Management Representative, with the participation of the Environmental Consultant and Environmental Unit Representatives. When determining the environmental impact and impact, new developments and changes, as well as abnormal/unforeseen emergencies, are taken into account. • Development of new services, • Changes in the tools, methods, and technologies used to provide services, • Significant increases or decreases in activities, • Changes in legislation and regulations, • Temporary projects (construction/installation), • Changes in the conditions and opinions of interested parties, • Emergencies encountered, • Environmental complaints/feedback/messages, • Results of corrective actions, • New environmental information, • Achieved environmental goals and objectives When conducting an environmental impact assessment, the criteria, scores, and formulation specified in the Environmental Impact Assessment Form (FPOP-S220-01-01) are used and recorded by the Environmental Officer. The prepared Environmental Impact Assessment Form (FPOP-S220-01-01) is published with the approval of the OHS and Environmental Management Representative and the Secretary General. The Environmental Impact Assessment Form (FPOP-S220-01-01) is reviewed if risks change in severity or frequency as a result of improvements made to the activities. The Environmental Impact Assessment Form (FPOP-S220-01-01) is updated immediately in the event of a significant regulatory change or a significant change in campus activities, or at least annually if this is not the case. The Environmental Impact Assessment Form (FPOP-S220-01-01) must be updated in the event of any environmental accident, chemical spill, new building investment, etc. 2. Legal and Other Requirements Compliance Assessment To fulfill SU's legal obligations, the Environmental Officer and Environmental Consultant define, control, and monitor changes to Legal and Other Requirements within the scope of university services. These are recorded in the Legal and Other Requirements Compliance Checklist (FPOP-S220-01-02). Legislative changes are monitored online through Lebib Yalkın, the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, and the Council of Higher Education (YÖK) legislation notifications. Changes to Legal and Other Requirements are adapted to the EMS, and relevant units and the Secretary General are informed of the new obligations and/or changes. The compliance of legal and other requirements is determined through internal audits conducted throughout the year. If any non-compliance is detected, a CA is opened under the Corrective Action Procedure (PGS-S620-03-01). Licenses, permits and authorizations that require budget, planning and reporting are listed in the Environmental Work Plan (FPOP-S220-01-06). 3. Environmental Goals and Targets SU environmental goals and targets are monitored by the OHS and Environmental Management Representative. The Environmental Management Program Form (FPOP-S220-01-03) created for the environmental goal and related targets is approved by the OHS and Environmental Management Representative. The achievement of the targets is monitored by the relevant unit and the results are reported to the OHS and Environmental Management Representative. The OHS and Environmental Management Representative submits a consolidated report at least annually, as per the Management Review Directive (IGS-S620-06), to evaluate targets and set new targets. 4. Control of Activities Necessary measures are determined regarding environmental pollution that may occur during activities conducted on campus. Field inspections are conducted to assess the compliance of campus activities with EMS requirements and are monitored annually through the Environmental Field Inspection Plan (FPOP-S220-01-12). Inspection results and necessary actions are shared with the OHS and Environmental Management Representative and relevant Environmental Unit Representatives. The environmental impact of purchased products and suppliers required for SU activities is assessed within the scope of the Procedure for Procurement of Goods/Services and Construction Works (PPOP-S810-01-01). Waste generated from campus activities and their management are handled within the scope of the Waste Management Procedure (PPOP-S220-01-01). Necessary precautions are taken during activities to maximize the efficient use and conservation of our energy and natural resources. Projects are implemented on campus to highlight environmentally friendly practices and develop innovative, environmentally compatible technologies. The Greenhouse Gas Emission Determination and Assessment Procedure (PPOP-S220-04-01) is used to calculate and record the SU carbon footprint. 5. Monitoring, Measurement, and Assessment of Compliance The environmental indicators to be monitored and measured within the scope of the EMS are defined in the Monitoring and Measurement Plan Form (FPOP-S220-01-06). Results from the indicators specified in the Monitoring and Measurement Plan Form (FPOP-S220-01-06) are monitored within the specified measurement frequency period. The OHS and Environmental Management Representative conducts the compliance assessment activity and discusses it at the Management Review meeting.
