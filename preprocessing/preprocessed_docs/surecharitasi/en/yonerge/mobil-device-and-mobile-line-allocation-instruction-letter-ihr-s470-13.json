Technical Specifications 1.3.1. Mobile Devices Mobile device standards are determined by IT and HR according to positions and needs within the university. It is essential that employees are provided with mobile devices that comply with these standards. Mobile device allocation is carried out in accordance with the Hardware and Software Provision Procedure (PIT-S130-0123). 1.3.2. Mobile Lines Mobile Lines determined by HR and packages determined by POP in line with the positions of employees are allocated. 1.4. Allocation and Usage Periods and Principles 1.4.1. Mobile Device Mobile device supply alternatives are made in accordance with the technology determined by IT. Mobile devices provided by the university are recorded into inventory and their usage periods are determined by IT. This period is determined as a minimum of 36 months for current technologies. IT is responsible for providing mobile devices and ensuring inventory tracking. 1.4.2. Mobile Line The invoice amount of employees provided with mobile lines within the scope of the allocated tariff is covered by the university and the invoices are followed up by the POP unit. The selection, tender and operation of the operator for the supply of mobile lines and data lines are carried out by POP under IT consultancy. POP is responsible for all processes to be carried out with the selected operator, such as purchasing/transfer/cancellation of new lines, supply/change of SIM cards suitable for the devices, definition/change of tariffs, making commitments when necessary, defining additional packages if package exceeding information is received, and providing PIN/PUK codes. In case the Mobile Line provided by the university is used abroad during trips made for duty purposes, employees must inform the POP unit and get an international package. The amount to be incurred due to usage made for special purpose trips will not be covered by the university and is reported to HR by POP at the end of the month to be deducted from the employee's salary. Any expenses that may arise from any extra package, donation, or application purchases to be incurred by employees outside of the defined package on Mobile Lines are individual expenses, but are communicated to HR by POP and deducted from the employee's salary. Users who are assigned a line for duty and general use inform the POP unit when going abroad. In cases where no notification is made, the cost incurred for exceeding the package usage is communicated to HR by POP, and if deemed necessary after the evaluation to be made by HR, it is deducted from the employee's first salary. 1.5. Other Issues How mobile devices that become obsolete during renewal/change processes will be utilized is at the discretion of IT and POP, which must inform/get the approval of the Secretary General and the President. In the event that an employee who is assigned a mobile communication device/line for general use or due to duty leaves the job, it is essential that the line, device and accessories (excluding headsets) are returned to the University in full before the employee’s departure date by following the steps in the Hardware and Software Provision Procedure (PIT-S130-0123). When the time comes to change the mobile communication devices allocated for status or when the employee leaves the job, a sales option is offered. The relevant procedures are carried out by following the steps in the Hardware and Software Provision Procedure (PIT-S130-0123). The employee who is about to leave the job can take over the company line if they wish. In this case, the transfer process is waited for the period between the date of leaving the job and the closest invoice date valid for company lines, operational processes are completed during this period and the transfer process is carried out on the invoice date. Thus, the employee can continue to use the line as of the day they leave without any interruption. The use of mobile communication devices and lines provided by the university to its employees against the law and Sabancı University policies is a reason for termination of the user's employment contract. The use of the allocated mobile communication device and line against the law only results in the legal/criminal liability of the Employee, Sabancı University has no liability. It is essential that the mobile devices and/or mobile lines of employees who were allocated a mobile device and/or mobile line before the effective date of this document but did not meet the allocation criteria with the effective instruction letter are not renewed at the time of change. These employees continue to use the devices until the device reaches its end of life. In the event of leaving the job, a sales option is offered. Relevant operations are carried out by following the steps in the Hardware and Software Provision Procedure (PIT-S130-0123). 2.
