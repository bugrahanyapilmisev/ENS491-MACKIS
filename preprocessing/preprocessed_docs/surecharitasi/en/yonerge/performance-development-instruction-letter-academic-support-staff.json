If there is a unit Manager other than the direct Manager, his/her views are taken in all the steps of the Performance Development System. ANNUAL REVIEWS Annual reviews are held in three stages: Target Setting Interim Report Review A. Target Setting: Each year, at the end of February, annual targets are set for all the employees for the following period. Before the annual target setting meeting, the employee proposes the targets he/she wants to achieve, their deadlines and the evaluation criteria to his/her Manager at the beginning of February. The Manager reviews the targets taking the following into consideration: Goals of the University Goals of the unit The responsibilities of the employee The expectations from the employee for that year The Manager makes a target setting meeting with the employee and explains the amendments he/she thinks to make. In this meeting, the weights of the targets and the evaluation criteria to be used in achieving these targets are determined and the targets are ordered according to their importance and priority. The targets are finalized and they are approved by the Manager. The targets consist of two headings called the “Main Responsibilities” and the “Other Professional Activities”. 1. Main Responsibilities Main responsibilities cover the employee’s individual or team responsibilities. These are the main tasks that the employee has to fulfil as a requirement of his/her functional group. 2. Other Professional Activities In addition to the main responsibilities of the employee, he/she may be expected to take responsibility under some of the following headings. The time to be allocated for other professional activities of the employee is mutually agreed on at the individual / functional level with the Manager taking the goals of the unit into consideration each year, in the annual target setting meetings. The ratio of the time allocated for other professional activities can not exceed 20% of time in principle.

The Evaluation Report prepared by the Manager is submitted to the Academic Support Staff Evaluation Committee. The Committee analyzes the report, and may accept the proposal of the evaluation result or may arrive at a different conclusion. At this stage, the committee selects “Outstanding” Performers among those who were evaluated as “Successful”. (1) Outstanding evaluation result means that the employee exceeds all the expectations in a consistent manner. The decision of the Academic Support Staff Evaluation Committee is final. The Manager gives verbal feedback to the employee about the evaluation result. The decisions are sent to Human Resources, who will inform the employee of the result formally, and take the necessary actions. AFTER THE PERIODIC REVIEW If the result of the periodic review is \"Satisfactory\", \"Successful\" or “Outstanding”, then the review cycle continues its usual course and the next periodic review is conducted after three years. However, if the result of the periodic review is “Probation”, the employee is given a six months period and a development plan is made for this period by the Manager. This plan includes tangible recommendations for improvement in each of the employee’s development areas and an action plan including the deadlines. During this period, the Manager monitors the work of the employee and gives guidance when necessary.

However, if the Committee decides that the performance of the employee is “Satisfactory”, the next periodic review will be conducted within the next three years. In case, at the end of the three years’ period, the result of the periodic review is again \"Probation\", then the employee's employment is terminated in accordance with his/her contract. Finally, where the quality of the employee's work is found to be well below the standards of Sabancı University, and no possibility of improvement could be foreseen, then, the periodic review can result in the termination of the employee's employment with the University.
