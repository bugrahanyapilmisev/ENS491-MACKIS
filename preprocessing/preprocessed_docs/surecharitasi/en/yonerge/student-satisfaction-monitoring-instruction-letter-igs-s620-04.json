Scope This instruction letter covers the processes within the scope of Sabancı University's integrated management system and the students who use these processes. Principle At Sabancı University, student satisfaction is essential in the processes within the scope of the integrated management system and other defined processes. Statutory Basis ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Standard ISO14001:2015 Environmental Management System Standard ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Standard Definitions / Abbreviations SU: Sabancı University NPS: Net Promoter Score IMS: Integrated Management System Integrated Management System Leader: SU employee working on the Integrated Management System in the Secretary General’s Office. Quality Management Representative: Secretary General’s Office Group Manager. Regulations 1. The primary customers of the units within the scope of the Sabancı University integrated management system are students. 2. It is essential that SU maintains the quality of service it offers to its students at a high level. 3. Satisfaction regarding the services provided to students is monitored regularly. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of student and employee satisfaction contributes significantly to the regular increase in the quality of services offered by SU. 4. Measurements are made on a service basis in order to obtain sufficiently in-depth feedback from students. 5. The Secretary General’s Office is responsible for measuring, analyzing and reporting student satisfaction. 6. Implementation steps for monitoring student satisfaction are defined in the Student and Employee Satisfaction Monitoring Procedure (PGS-620-0401). Survey Method 7. Services to be measured for satisfaction within the relevant academic year are planned by the Quality Management Representative and the Integrated Management System Leader. 8. The “NPS: Net Promoter Score” method is used to measure student satisfaction. In this method, student measurement is based on questions and ranges determined on a service basis. Participants evaluate the service on a 10-point scale. While those who score 9 and 10 are referred to as promoters, they tend to exhibit value-creating behaviors such as giving references to their surroundings about the service. Those who score between 0-6 are referred to as detractors and are less inclined to exhibit value-creating behaviors. Those who score 7 and 8 are passives and fall between those who promote and those who detract. The Net Promoter Score is obtained by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. 9. Satisfaction regarding the services provided to students is planned at the beginning of the relevant year. Due to force majeure, surveys may be temporarily suspended with the knowledge of the senior management. Creating Service-Based Sending Lists 10. At the beginning of each academic year, the services and survey sending periods for which satisfaction will be measured are planned by the Quality Management Representative and Integrated Management Systems Leader. 11. Satisfaction measurement regarding dormitory services is carried out by sending surveys to students staying in the dormitory. Evaluation of Analysis Results 12. In order to conduct an effective satisfaction analysis, it is important that at least 10% of the people to whom the survey is sent participate in the evaluation. 13. As a result of the measurement, the scores given by the people to whom the survey was sent are analyzed and the Net Promoter Score is determined for each service, and the increases and decreases in service quality are monitored by comparing the Net Promoter Score obtained from previous measurements of the relevant service, and all measurement results are analyzed. In the Net Promoter Score of the services provided; a . If there is dissatisfaction, negative results and a decrease in the service, the reasons and suggestions on how to fix it are developed, if there is satisfaction, positive results and an increase, suggestions on how to improve it are developed. It is followed in accordance with the Corrective Action Procedure (PGS-S620-03-01). b. All analysis results and improvement suggestions are presented in the Management Review meetings. 14 .
