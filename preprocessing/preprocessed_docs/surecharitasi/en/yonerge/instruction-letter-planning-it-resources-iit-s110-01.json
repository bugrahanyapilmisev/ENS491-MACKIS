Scope All Information Technology products and services planned for use within the University are within the scope of this instruction letter. Principle Advanced planning, along with alignment with the University&#39;s strategy and resource allocation, is essential for the development of IT resources and the implementation of ongoing support and update activities. Statutory Basis Definitions / Abbreviations IT: Information Technologies Regulations 1. IT Needs Assessment 1.1. The following points are taken into consideration when meeting or prioritizing IT product, service, consultancy, and support needs. Following resource allocation, the University conducts development or acquisition activities during the phase to meet needs. Strategic Alignment: In particular, alignment with the University's strategic objectives is assessed for newly emerging IT needs requiring additional resource investment. Benefit: The benefits to be achieved in line with strategic objectives determine the priorities of IT investments and development activities. Priority is given to IT projects, processes, and applications that generate revenue, generate savings, and enhance quality. Cost: IT products and services require long-term maintenance, update, and support investments in addition to the initial investment and development activities. In this context, long-term assessments are conducted, taking into account sustainability conditions, particularly in terms of financial and other resources. Technological Trends: While the goal is to provide the most up-to-date products, services, and approaches to the University's stakeholders, we adapt to technological trends as new needs arise, taking into account both costs and potential benefits. Furthermore, to protect previous investments and ensure technical integration, newly emerging needs are evaluated within the framework of existing resources. 1.2. Needs identification and assessment are conducted in accordance with the Requirements Gathering and Assessment (PIT- S110-0101) procedure. 2. Resource Planning 2.1. The IT unit operates with annual business plans, considering the efficient use of resources (budget, workforce, etc.) and continuous support and update services in line with long-term needs. New opportunities must be developed and existing ones must be planned and included in the work schedule in the previous budget period. Requirements not planned in the previous budget year are not included in the business plan and are evaluated for the following year. 2.2. Requirements can be met through internal or external resources. Internal resources are preferred to technologically support the University's core activities of education and research, in line with strategic objectives. The general approach has been to outsource all products and services that are feasible and suitable for external needs, including long-term support and maintenance requirements. 3. Review of Resources The following observations and controls are conducted to continuously improve IT resources and ensure their development in line with needs and technological advancements. As a result of continuous observations and evaluations, potential improvements are planned in conjunction with investment requirements. Review activities are conducted in accordance with the IT Services Review (PIT-S110-0102) procedure, and a Service Review Report is prepared at the end of each year, and potential improvements are addressed within the IT unit's annual operating plan. Security Controls: These are checks against security vulnerabilities conducted both within the scope of internal procedures and with the support of third-party expert firms. Disaster Preparedness: These are controls on activities aimed at protecting critical data against potential disaster risks. User Satisfaction Surveys: These are feedback received from user groups about various services. Troubleshooting and Support Services Analysis (Helpdesk): These are analyses of user requests for assistance or problems encountered regarding services and resources. Service Continuity: This is the analysis of service interruptions that occur for any reason. Technological Lifespan: This involves the identification of hardware, software, applications, and methods that have reached the end of their technological lifespan. IT Unit Capacity: This involves the review of the IT unit's resources (budget, personnel, workload, etc.) based on expected achievements in line with strategic objectives.
