Promotion: Every year, IRO conducts promotional activities for students according to the promotional plan prepared by IRO. 3. Exchange Duration: Participation periods for exchange programs are determined by the host institutions and program organizers. 4. Application Procedures: The number of students to be sent within the scope of the exchange program, the duration of the exchange, and the partner universities are announced by the UIO on the website in each application period. Undergraduate and graduate students who meet the eligibility criteria must complete the procedures defined in the Procedure for Outgoing Students for Exchange Programs (PIRO-C420-0101). During the online application, they are required to prepare and upload their official transcript and the Financial Commitment Form. In addition, graduate students must also upload the Advisor Approval Form (FIRO-C42001-08). Applications of students who fail to upload the required documents, or upload them incompletely, will be invalid. 5. Selection of Students for Exchange: Among the candidates who meet the application criteria and submit the required documents accurately, completely, and on time, the selection of students to participate in exchange programs is carried out jointly by EC and IRO. The selection process takes into account language proficiency, academic performance ranking, as well as faculty priorities and quotas. For Erasmus programs, student selection is conducted in line with the evaluation criteria and weightings announced by the National Agency (UA) for the relevant academic year, in addition to considering language proficiency, academic performance ranking, faculty priorities, and quotas. Furthermore, the Exchange Committee may establish additional criteria. The evaluation criteria and their weightings are as follows: - Academic performance: 50% - Language proficiency: 50% 6. Announcement of Selected Students: IRO announces the list of all selected undergraduate and graduate students for the exchange program, without including names, but indicating the host university, agreement area, exchange period, application round, and total points. Students who are placed in one of their preferred options are given a period to confirm their placement via the online application system. Students who fail to confirm within the specified period forfeit their placement. For students who confirm, IRO makes the first notification to the host universities. Preparing and submitting documents required by the host institution is the responsibility of the student. During the partner institution’s application process, IRO offers guidance to students as needed. Travel, visa, and accommodation arrangements are the students’ responsibility. Once the host institution issues the final acceptance letter, the student’s official acceptance/registration process begins. Following the announcement of the results, a period is given for students who wish to appeal the selection and placement decisions. Students may submit their appeals to IRO within the specified period. 7.Financial Support Provided by the European Commission – Erasmus+ Grant: (For students placed under Erasmus only) 7.1. The European Commission, through the National Agency, provides limited financial support to students going on exchange under the Erasmus+ Program. This support, called the Erasmus+ Grant, does not cover all expenses abroad and is considered supplementary. 7.2. Due to limited resources, students eligible for the grant are determined by the Exchange Committee based on faculty and overall achievement quotas. Lists are created by ranking students from highest to lowest points according to the assessment criteria and weighted points announced by UA each academic year. Faculty and general success quotas are set by the Exchange Committee and communicated to students. 7.3. Students entitled to Erasmus+ grants must sign a Student Agreement with the university before receiving the grant. This agreement outlines the main principles and rules regarding grant usage. 7.4. Erasmus+ grants are paid according to the amounts announced by UA for the related year. 7.5. Payments are made in two installments. To receive the first installment before departure, students must sign the Grant Agreement and complete the first Learning Agreement. 7.6. A student returning from a Student Exchange Program is required to submit the following documents to the International Relations Office (IRO): partner university's transcript, completed and signed Learning Agreement, signed and stamped Certificate of Attendance, which indicates the duration of their stay abroad. Additionally, students who participated in the Erasmus+ program must also submit online European Commission evaluation survey for the exchange period and signed and stamped Certificate of Attendance, which shows the duration of their stay. The final grant payment is calculated based on the number of days the student stayed at the host institution. This amount is determined by a daily rate and cannot exceed the total grant amount specified in the grant agreement. It's not possible to receive a payment that is more than the amount stated in the agreement. 7.7. Grant deductions may apply in the following cases: - Failure to complete the online European Commission survey - Failure to submit the Certificate of Attendance - Failure to submit the transcript for the exchange period - Academic failure 7.8. Students may choose to participate programs without receiving a grant. 7.9. Except for force majeure, students returning before completing the minimum required period will have their activity considered invalid, and the grant will not be paid. 7.10. If participation documents (Certificate of Attendance or equivalent transcript) are not submitted, the exchange is considered invalid, and the grant will not be paid; any initial payments must be reimbursed to the university. 7.11. Students who fail all courses taken during the exchange will have a 20% deduction applied to the final grant amount, calculated based on the number of days they spent at the host institution according to the Certificate of Attendance. 8. Payment of SU Scholarship: In principle, if an undergraduate student who receives a cash scholarship under a program implemented at SU is eligible for an exchange program, the cash scholarship payments continue during the exchange period. Similarly, if an undergraduate student with a dormitory scholarship is eligible to participate in an exchange program, one of the following options applies: - The student is given the equivalent cash of the SU dormitory scholarship per semester, and the responsibility for accommodation in the host country is entirely on the student. - If the undergraduate student receives a monthly or semester-based cash scholarship, this payment is not interrupted and continues in accordance with the SU scholarship regulations and procedures. - If a graduate student participating in an exchange program has a full or partial tuition waiver, this status continues unchanged. - Graduate students who pay tuition fees fully or partially at SU continue these payments during the exchange period. - Under no circumstances can payment be made to any account other than the bank account specified by SU or in cash to any other person. 9. Learning Agreement (LA): The student selected for the exchange prepares, signs, and submits the LA, which specifies the content of the courses to be taken abroad, within the period announced by UIO, with the knowledge and approval of the exchange academic advisor, and ensures that it is signed by the partner institution. The exchange academic advisor determines, approves, or requests changes for the following sections of the ECTS LA: • The outgoing student’s course selections, • Determination of SU equivalent credits for the selected courses, • Determination of SU equivalent course types for the selected courses, • Determination of ECTS credit values for the selected courses. Within this process, it is ensured that the courses taken abroad are accepted in place of the courses the student must take at their home university during the same period. When preparing the LA, the student must consider SU graduation requirements. This responsibility lies with the student. The student is obliged to inform the Exchange Academic Advisor of any changes in the course schedule before completing the relevant term at the partner university and to obtain approval within the framework of the Learning Agreement. For rules and practices not covered here, the provisions of Procedure for Learning Agreement (PIRO-C420-0102) apply. 10. Course Transfer (Recognition) 10.1 Students wishing to transfer courses taken under the exchange program and to repeat or count courses after the exchange program are subject to the provisions of the Instruction Letter for Sabancı University Undergraduate Programs and Instruction Letter for Graduate Programs. 10.2 Courses taken under the exchange program and at which higher education institution are clearly indicated in the student’s transcript and diploma supplement. 11. Total Credits to be taken Abroad: Undergraduate and graduate students selected for the exchange program can take a maximum of 30 ECTS credits per semester according to their Learning Agreement (LA). The minimum course load for undergraduate students is 4 courses or 20 ECTS per semester. Graduate students determine their semester course load in consultation with their advisors. 12. General Rules: • As a SU student, those participating in an exchange program at a foreign university or equivalent institution for a specific term must comply with the academic and administrative rules of the host institution. SU students continue their studies with the guidance and support of the International Relations Office at the host university. • Any legal or criminal liability arising from the student’s activities abroad is the responsibility of the student. SU does not assume any liability regarding risks the student may face abroad. • Students participating in exchange programs are notified each semester by IRO to the relevant Faculties, Accommodation Services, and Student Resources Unit. • The status of students abroad for one term is updated as “Exchange Student” in SU information system by Student Resources Unit during the exchange period. 13. Health Insurance: Students participating in an exchange program must obtain health insurance covering health expenses and the duration of their stay in the host country. The private health insurance provided to all full-time students at SU does not cover health expenses during the study period abroad. Students can obtain health insurance in Turkey as travel insurance before departure or choose health insurance options available in the host country. All expenses and responsibilities related to health and travel insurance are entirely the student’s responsibility. 14. Transcript and Grade Conversion: At the end of the exchange period, the SU student who has completed their studies abroad submits the transcript to Student Resources Unit via IRO for grade submission. Monitoring the transcript and submitting it to Student Resources Unit is the student’s responsibility. In cases where transcripts are sent directly from the partner institution to IRO, and IRO informs student and forwards transcript to Student Resources Unit. The grades received from the host university abroad are converted into the Sabancı University grading system by the Administrative Board (ÖK), based on the conversion tables approved by the Academic Board, and then recorded in the system. During the grade transfer process, only the courses listed in the approved Learning Agreement are transferred into the SU system. Grades from courses not specified in the Learning Agreement are not taken into account. Other notes regarding grade conversion: -If the transcript from the partner institution contains grades such as “P” (Progressing), “S” (Satisfactory), or “U” (Unsatisfactory) instead of letter grades, conversion to the SU credit and grading system is determined by the relevant Faculty/Graduate School. -If withdrawal from a course is indicated as ‘drop’ in the LA, the course with a W (withdraw) grade is not transferred to the SU system. -Courses not taken or left without notice, despite being indicated in the approved LA, are transferred as 'F' in the SU system. -Other matters regarding grades are subject to the Instruction Letter for Sabancı University Undergraduate Programs and Instruction Letter for Sabancı University Graduate Programs.
