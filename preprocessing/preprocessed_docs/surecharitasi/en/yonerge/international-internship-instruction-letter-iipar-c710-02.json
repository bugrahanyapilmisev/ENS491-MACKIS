Bilateral Agreements with Organizations 2.1 A protocol is prepared with the organizations where international internships will take place, outlining internship principles, application requirements, and available opportunities, and shared with the Legal Unit via SUForm. The agreement is signed after approval from the Legal Unit. 2.2 For bilateral agreements, the internship duration is a minimum of 4 weeks; the maximum duration varies by organization. 2.3 The Internship Office shares the organizations’ application requirements and provided opportunities with students at the beginning of each spring semester. 2.4 Students who meet the application requirements submit their CVs, transcripts, and any additional information specified in the bilateral agreement to the Career Development and Internship Office. 2.5 Student selections are made in cooperation with at least two faculty members relevant to the internship topic and the Career Development and Internship Office. 2.6 Student applications for internship opportunities are listed and shared with the relevant faculty members.

Erasmus+ Internship Mobility 3.1 The Erasmus+ Internship Mobility program is conducted in cooperation with the International Office (IO). 3.2 The Erasmus+ Internship Mobility program is a process in which a student gains professional training and/or work experience at an enterprise, higher education institution, or organization in an Erasmus+ Program country. 3.3 Erasmus+ Internship Mobility cannot be used for academic research activities such as studies or analyses related to academic work. 3.4 The internship activity provides the student with practical work experience in their field of study. The sector in which the internship is carried out must be related to the student’s degree program. 3.5 Having previously benefited from the Erasmus+ Study Mobility does not prevent a student from participating in the Internship Mobility. A student can benefit from Erasmus+ programs for a maximum of 12 months per study cycle (Study Cycle refers to Undergraduate/Master’s/Doctoral levels). 3.6 Students in their final year can benefit from Erasmus+ Internship Mobility if they apply to any Erasmus+ Internship Mobility call opened during the academic calendar of their graduation year. 3.7 Within the Erasmus+ Internship Mobility Program, at the beginning of March each year, the Career Development and Internship Office determines the grant amount planned for the following year and communicates it to the IO. The IO requests grants from the National Agency for the next year’s quotas, and the quotas allocated to SU are received by the end of April. 3.8 Hosting organizations may include training centers, research centers, and other entities that fit the definition of an enterprise. Organizations not eligible for Erasmus+ Internship Mobility include European Union institutions and EU agencies, organizations running EU programs and receiving grants, and diplomatic representations in the host country. 3.9 The minimum duration of an internship mobility is 2 months. 3.10 Students wishing to apply for Erasmus+ Internship Mobility must meet the following criteria in addition to the Program Rules specified in the Erasmus+ Implementation Handbook published by the NA each year: Obtain an “Acceptance Letter” from the host organization for a minimum internship period of 2 months Have a GPA of at least 2.20 for undergraduates / 2.5 for graduates 3.11 Erasmus+ Internship Mobility application requirements and necessary documents are published on the internal web and internship website starting at the end of October. 3.12 Eligible undergraduate and graduate students complete their applications through the Online Application System by following the procedures defined in the Erasmus+ Outgoing Student Procedure (PIPAR-C710-0201) and submit their documents to the Internship Office. 3.13 For undergraduate students who submit complete and timely documents, ENG 101-102 course grades or SPS and AL course grades are calculated, and language scores are determined based on the equivalence table of Foreign Language Exams recommended by the Council of Higher Education. Graduate/Doctoral students’ TOEFL/YDS/ELAE results are converted according to the same table. 3.14 Each student’s Erasmus+ Score is calculated by taking 50% of the calculated language score and 50% of the GPA. 3.15 The Internship Office lists students in order of highest Erasmus+ Score. 3.16 The prepared list is submitted for approval to the Student Selection Committee. 3.17 Grants are distributed sequentially to students on the approved list according to the total grant amount. 3.18 The information of students who receive grants is announced by the Internship Office on the internal web and internship website. 3.19 Before attending the internship, selected students must have the Erasmus+ Internship Mobility Agreement signed by the host organization. The Learning Agreement, Grant Agreement, and Travel and Insurance documents must be completed. Students submit their Learning Agreements to the relevant faculty member via SUFORM to get academic approval for internship content and upload all documents to the application system, notifying the Internship Office. 3.20 The monthly grant amount and payment method are communicated to universities by the National Agency. Grant agreements are signed with students attending the internship, and payments are made in two installments: 80% before the internship and 20% after the student completes the internship and submits all required documents to their Euro account. 3.21 After completing the internship, students receive a Participation Certificate (FID-C71002-03) from the organization confirming at least 2 months of internship and complete the Student Internship Mobility Final Report (the Online EU Survey automatically sent by the Beneficiary Module). 3.22 All student documents are archived by the Internship Office. 3.23 If a student must return early from the planned mobility due to mandatory reasons (family, health, etc.), the grant amount corresponding to the period abroad remains with the student, and any overpaid grant must be returned. If the student does not complete the activity period without justification, the full grant is reclaimed. (See: Erasmus+ Implementation Handbook) 3.24 The Internship Office shares the list of all students who successfully complete their internships with Student Resources and relevant faculties. With the Faculty Board decision, Erasmus+ Internship Mobility students’ transcripts/diploma supplements are updated to ensure full academic recognition of the Erasmus+ Internship Program.
