["We have been working to change the culture regarding academic dishonesty for the last several \nyears and have come to the conclusion that much more effort is needed. We must have a \nunified approach. Establishment of this cultural change will take many years and it requires \ncommitment from all of us. \nIn order to minimize the discrepancies of how academic integrity violations are dealt with \nacross and within faculties, we are moving to a new model. In the attached file it is underlined \nthat \"the main instructor personally reports all incidences with preponderance of evidence for \nviolations of academic integrity, without exceptions, to the Dean or the Director's office.\" \nIt is also stated that the academic integrity policy for each course is appended to the syllabus and \nannounced to the students at the beginning of the course. \nThe situation regarding academic integrity is going to be reviewed once a year in a meeting of the \nDeans' Board. A record of the year's Academic Integrity applications, including selec ted cases and \nstatistics, is issued by the Board after this meeting and publicized prominently over the internal web \nsite.", "The report protects the privacy and anonymity of the persons involved. The Director of Student \nResources implements the publication. \nPlease carefully read the attached file with name \"academicintegrity.doc\" for details of the \nimplementation. \nPlease report any violations of academic integrity to your dean/director by filling out the \nattached form with name \"violation log.xls\". \nFor disciplinary procedures please refer to \nStudent Discipline Instruction Letter ISR-C210-01 \nStudent Discipline Procedure PSR-C210-0101"]
